      <ion-card-subtitle>About Venite</ion-card-subtitle>
      <ion-card-title>
        “Come, let us sing to the <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span>.”
      </ion-card-title>
      <p>
        So begins Psalm 95, the traditional invitatory psalm of the Anglican
        service of Morning Prayer—known from its Latin <em>incipit</em> as “The <em>Venite</em>.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Venite.app is one convenient way to pray; nothing more, and nothing
        less. It’s the 2020 edition of a project I’ve been working on since
        2015, and I hope you’ll find it an elegant and flexible way to structure
        your life of prayer.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the extent that this app is useful, it’s only because it stands on
        the proverbial shoulders of giants. I learned to pray using the classic
        Daily Office sites from
        <a href="https://www.missionstclare.com/english/index.html" target="_system">
          The Mission of St. Clare
        </a> and from Derek Olsen’s Haligweorc, now
        <a href="http://www.stbedeproductions.com/breviary/" target="_system">St. Bede’s Breviary</a>.
        All my work is deeply indebted to and inspired by these two sources, and especially to the fantastic
        <a href="https://www.bcponline.org/" target="_system">bcponline.org</a>.
      </p>
      <p>Anglicans in Canada who use the 1962 Book of Common Prayer may find
        <a href="http://prayerbook.ca/resources/bcp-app/" target="_system">the app I developed in collaboration
        with the Prayer Book Society of Canada</a> edifying.
      </p> 
      <p>If you’re looking for a way to pray from the 2019 ACNA prayer book, I commend Benjamin Locher’s
        <a href="https://www.dailyoffice2019.com/" target="_system">Daily Office 2019</a>. Members
        of the Church of England might find
        <a href="https://aimermedia.com/app/dailyprayer/" target="_system">Daily Prayer</a> helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Developing this app is only a hobby for me, but I try to fix bugs and
        add new features and content when I can. Feel free to contact me any
        time with suggestions or questions at the email address or Twitter
        account below.

      <ion-card-content>
        <p>People who’ve found Venite fruitful for their prayer life sometimes ask how they can support the work.</p>
        <p>The three best ways to support this app are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Pledge to your local parish, and participate fully in its worship and community life.</li>
          <li>Pray regularly for me and for the community who pray here with you.</li>
          <li>Share the app with a friend.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I’m lucky to be an ordained priest with a parish ministry, a good salary, and benefits. However, the app does cost about $75/month to host and operate; and that’s without counting all the time I spend on it!
        </p>
        <p>
          So by popular request, I’ve created a Patreon account where people can subscribe to support this work.
        </p>
        <p *ngIf="!canDonate">Unfortunately, Apple and Google policies both now prevent linking to my Patreon from within their apps, and take an unsustainable cut of money that's given through their in-app donations, but you can find me on Patreon by searching for my name.</p>

        <p>I’ve spent quite a while developing the new version of this app. If you’re coming from the old version, you may notice a few differences:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>If you’re used to logging in with an email and password, you’ll need to create a new account. I’ve changed providers for this, and the new one will hopefully work much better, but security prevented transferring old passwords over.</li>
          <li>Most of your preferences should transfer automatically, but you may want to check to make sure things are set the way you like them.</li>
          <li>There’s a new “Report an Issue” button in the menu that you can use to share any bug reports with me.</li>
          <li>The app now works mostly offline, with the exception of Biblical readings.</li>
          <li>Finally, most of the work has been completely revamping the bulletin editor. You can check out the videos in the <a routerLink="/tutorials">Tutorials</a> section to learn more.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Thanks, as always, for your support.<br>Greg</p>
