        "Episcopal military chaplains care for their flock of men, women, and children stationed in countries around the world, as well as at bases in the United States. In times of battle, chaplains often accompany their units—only without any weapons—in order to provide pastoral care, sacramental rites, and the comfort of prayer under extreme stress. They ably administer rites and logistical assistance in field hospitals and veterans centers, National Guard postings, and frequently a parish at home. Many Episcopal chaplains currently serve the Armed Forces of the United States.",
        "The ministry of the Rev. Frederick “Ted” Howden, Jr., stands out among many heroic chaplaincies. He was twelve years old when his father was consecrated bishop of the Missionary District of New Mexico and Southwest Texas. His father ordained him deacon at St. Clement’s Church in El Paso, Texas, on June 10, 1928, and priest, also at St. Clement’s, on January 13, 1929. Ted Howden immediately began to serve several congregations in New Mexico, traveling great distances between them.",
        "When World War II broke out, Howden held the rank of captain in the New Mexico State Guard, a unit predominantly made up of Hispanic, Latino, and Native Americans. He was the chaplain to the 200th Coast Artillery when it was federalized and sent to the Philippines in September 1941. He walked across the hills, from battery to battery, holding open-air services and distributing candy, soap, and cigarettes he had foraged for the troops.",
        "When Bataan and Corregidor fell to Japanese forces in April and May 1942, Howden and his fellow soldiers were made prisoners of war and were forced to endure the Bataan Death March, during which some 18,000 died. During imprisonment in several prison camps, his heroism and faith were always apparent through the care he provided. Howden often gave his own food rations to others, insisting that they needed it more. He died of dysentery and starvation-induced pellagra on December 11, 1942, and was buried by his men in a small cemetery in the jungle of Mindanao, about a mile from the camp. His family would not learn of his fate until June 1943. After the war, in 1948, his remains were reinterred in Albuquerque, New Mexico.",
        "Howden has been commemorated in the Diocese of the Rio Grande, particularly by veterans of the armed forces and their families who have faced physical, spiritual, and emotional harm; disabling injuries; and death itself while in the service of our country. Recalling his self-sacrifice, the Church honors all who answer our Lord’s call to chaplaincy in the world’s most dangerous places."

        "Episcopal deaconesses joined a wider, multidenominational movement that began in Europe in the nineteenth century. Deaconesses ministered as nurses, teachers, chaplains, caregivers, administrators, fundraisers, and missionaries both within the United States and around the world. Episcopal deaconesses ministered both as individuals and as communities. They often served under difficult conditions, with little compensation, and always under gendered definitions. They ministered in times of peace and in times of war.",
        "The Bishop of Maryland set apart the first six deaconesses in the Episcopal Church on September 21, 1857. Four of their names are known: Adeline Blanchard Tyler, Evaline Black, Carrie Guild, and Catherine Minard. Other bishops soon followed suit. Thirty-two years later, the General Convention recognized the ministry of deaconesses canonically thanks to the efforts of Mary Abbot Emery Twing and William Reed Huntington.",
        "Notable deaconesses over the 113-year time span include Rebecca Hewitt, a caregiver, administrator, and leader of deaconesses in Alabama during the Civil War; Jessie Carryl Smith, a World War I nurse in France and later a missionary in Alaska; Jane Harris Hall, advocate for women in the New York theater industry in the early twentieth century; Susan Trevor Knapp, dean of the New York Training School for Deaconesses and a missionary in pre-World War II Japan; and staff members of the Appleton Church Home in Georgia, including Margaret Jennings and Sophjenlife Peterson, each a caregiver, formation leader, and head deaconess of the Appleton Church Home, and Mary Frances Gould, teacher, leader, and facilitator of mission work throughout the Diocese of Georgia; Harriet Bedell, a missionary in Oklahoma, Alaska, and Florida, who is commemorated on January 8; and Anna Alexander, who ministered in Georgia and is commemorated on September 24. With the establishment of formation programs in several states and communities for their life and work, the number of deaconesses in the Episcopal Church grew, peaking in 1922 with 226 living deaconesses. When in 1970 women were admitted to ordination as deacons, the Church’s deaconesses were recognized as deacons, and women were counted among clergy for the first time.",
        "As of March 2022, Priscilla Jean Wright is the last living woman deacon who was originally made a deaconess. She was set apart as a deaconess on June 18, 1964, in the Diocese of Los Angeles. Some 500 Episcopal deaconesses blessed the Church and the world with their diverse ministries and provided an example of courageous faithfulness that challenged later generations to recognize God’s call to women."

Her election and subsequent consecration were not without controversy, including threats on her life by those opposed to the inclusion of women in the House of Bishops. Despite these threats, she was consecrated bishop on February 11, 1989. Sixty bishops served as co-consecrators before a congregation of eight thousand people.",
        "As a bishop, Harris shaped a generation of leaders through her powerful preaching as chief pastor at the Cathedral Church of St. Paul in Boston; her witnessing, preaching, and teaching in the Diocese of Massachusetts and beyond; her advocacy for, in her words, “the least, the last, and the lost”; and her joy in sharing her faith, especially through hymns. She said of her work as a bishop, “I certainly don’t want to be one of the boys. I want to offer my peculiar gifts as a black woman . . . a sensitivity and an awareness that comes out of more than a passing acquaintance with oppression.”",

After her retirement, she served from 2003 to 2007 as an assisting bishop in the Diocese of Washington, D.C. and she continued to be in demand worldwide as a preacher until the end of her life.",

Some suggest that he was a Jewish convert, while others contend that he was a “Godfearer.” Regardless of his previous religious affiliation, scripture records him as the first African person to be baptized.",
        "Simeon Bachos was a person of great prestige, serving the Candace, or Queen, as both chamberlain and treasurer. His status as a eunuch indicates that he was a member of a sexual minority, either a castrated male, a deliberately celibate male, or a gender nonconformist. Irenaeus describes Simeon Bachos’ life after baptism, saying, “This man was also sent into the regions of Ethiopia, to preach what he had himself believed.” In the fourth century, the historian Eusebius wrote that “the Eunuch became an apostle for his people.” The tenth- century Synaxarion of Constantinople designates August 27 as the commemoration of Simeon Bachos.",
        "As a person of a different race, ethnicity, and gender identification, Simeon Bachos stands at the intersection of multiple marginalized groups. His identity shows that the early church was able to transcend social categories in its evangelizing work and that the gospel’s message would spread to the ends of the earth and to every person. Simeon Bachos calls Christians to be fully inclusive and welcoming of all people, empowering them for ministry and leadership."

        "Absalom Jones was born enslaved to Abraham Wynkoop a wealthy Anglican planter in 1746 in Delaware.  He was working in the fields when Abraham recognized that he was an intelligent child and ordered that he be trained to work in the house.  Absalom eagerly accepted instruction in reading, and saved money he was given to buy books. Abraham Wynkoop died in 1753. When Absalom was sixteen, Abraham’s son Benjamin Wynkoop sold the plantation and Absalom’s mother, sister, and five brothers.  He brought Absalom to Philadelphia where he opened a store and joined St. Peter’s Church. ",
        "With the permission of their masters, Absalom married Mary Thomas who was enslaved to Sarah King who also worshipped at St. Peter’s. Absalom and his father-in-law, John Thomas, used their savings, and sought donations and loans primarily from prominent Quakers, in order to purchase Mary’s freedom. Absalom and Mary worked hard to repay the money borrowed to buy her freedom.  They saved enough money to buy property and to buy Absalom’s freedom.  Although he repeatedly asked Benjamin Wynkoop to allow him to buy his freedom, Wynkoop had refused. Finally, in 1784, he freed Absalom by granting him a manumission. Absalom continued to work in Wynkoop’s store as a paid employee.",
        "Absalom then left St. Peter’s Church and began worshipping at St. George’s Methodist Episcopal Church.  He met Richard Allen who had been engaged to preach at St. George’s and the two became lifelong friends.  Together, in 1787, they founded the Free African Society a mutual aid benevolent organization that was the first of its kind organized by and for black people. At St George’s, Absalom and Richard served as lay ministers for the black membership.  The black members worked hard to help raise money to build an upstairs gallery intended to enlarge the church. The church leadership decided to segregate the black worshippers in the gallery, without notifying them.  During a Sunday morning service, a dispute arose over the seats black members had been instructed to take in the gallery, and ushers attempted to physically remove them by first accosting Absalom Jones. Most of the black members indignantly walked out in protest.",
        "In 1792 the Free African Society began to build the African Church of Philadelphia.  The church membership took a vote and decided to affiliate with the Episcopal Church. Absalom Jones was asked to provide pastoral leadership and after prayer and reflection he accepted the call. The African Church was dedicated on July 17th, 1794. Soon thereafter the congregation applied for membership in the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania on the following conditions:  1) that they be received as an organized body; 2) that they have control over their own local affairs; 3) that Absalom Jones be licensed as layreader, and, if qualified, be ordained as a priest.  In October 1794 it was admitted as the African Episcopal Church of St Thomas.  Bishop William White ordained Jones as deacon in 1795 and as priest on September 21st, 1802.",
        "Jones was an earnest preacher.  He denounced slavery, and warned the oppressors to “clean their hands of slaves.”  To him, God was the Father, who always acted on “behalf of the oppressed and distressed.”  But it was his constant visiting and mild manner that made him beloved by his congregation and by the community.  St Thomas Church grew to over 500 members during its first year.  Known as “the Black Bishop of the Episcopal Church,” Jones was an example of persistent faith in God and in the Church as God’s instrument. Jones died on February 13th, 1818."

By the time she had completed her doctorate, a position had been created for her on the faculty of the Teachers’ College at Columbia, where she rose to the status of full professor and head of the department of religious education. She is remembered for advocating a child-centered rather than teacher-centered approach to education.",

Although other women had taught occasional courses in the seminaries of the church, Case was the first to take her place as a full-time faculty member at the rank of Professor. ",
        "Case identified with the liberal Catholic tradition in Anglicanism. This is reflected in her first book, Liberal Christianity and Religious Education, in which she emphasized teaching children to engagein reasonable inquiry into their faith. Case was also active in the Religious Education Association, the Episcopal Pacifist Fellowship, and the Women’s Auxiliary of the Episcopal Church. From 1946 to 1948, she served on the National Council of the Episcopal Church. Case was a proponent of women’s ordination and a frequent preacher in the chapel at ETS.

It was often said of her that she was a true believer in Christ, and that one saw Christ living in and through her. ",

While still a youth, he was sent for education in upper-class life to thecourt of King David of Scotland, son of Queen Margaret. The king’s stepsons, Simon and Waldef, were his models and intimate friends. But after intense disillusionment and inner struggle, Aelred went to Yorkshire, where he became a Cistercian monk at the abbey of Rievaulx in 1133. ",

Here he made a deep impression on Bernard, who encouraged the young monk to write his first work, The Mirror of Charity, on Christian perfection. In 1143, Aelred led the founding of a new Cistercian house at Revesby. Four years later, he was appointed abbot of Rievaulx. By the time of his death in 1167, the abbey had more than 600 monks, including Aelred’s biographer and friend, Walter Daniel. During this period, Aelred wrote his best known work, Spiritual Friendship. ",
        "Friendship, Aelred teaches, is both a gift from God and a creation of human effort. While love should be universal and freely given to all, friendship is a particular love between individuals, of which the example is Jesus and John the Beloved Disciple. As abbot, Aelred allowed his monks to hold hands and give other expressions of friendship. In the spirit of Anselm of Canterbury and Bernard of Clairvaux, Aelred writes: ",
        "“There are four qualities that characterize a friend: Loyalty, right intention, discretion, and patience. Right intention seeks for nothing other than God and natural good. Discretion brings understanding of what is done on a friend’s behalf, and ability to know when to correct faults. Patience enables one to be justly rebuked, or to bear adversity on another’s behalf. Loyalty guards and protects friendship, in good or bitter times.”",

After only two years of marriage, her husband died, and she took shelter with an elderly Christian widow who taught her more about the faith.  In 1852, the missionary priest Fr. Auguste Chapdelaine heard of her education in the scriptures and in Christian doctrine, and he invited her to accompany him to the province of Guangxi in order to catechize women and children there.

Wherever in his way he saw any, either rich or poor, he invited them, if pagans, to embrace the mystery of the faith; or if they were believers, to strengthen them in their faith and stir them up by words and actions to alms and good works.” "

        "Alban gave shelter to a Christian priest who was fleeing from persecution and was converted by him. When officers came to Alban’s house, he dressed himself in the garments of the priest and gave himself up. Alban was tortured and martyred in place of the priest, on the hilltop where the Cathedral of St. Alban’s now stands. The traditional date of his martyrdom is 303 or 304, although the dates 209 and 251 have also been suggested by some scholars.   ",
        "The site of Alban’s martyrdom soon became a shrine. King Offa of Mercia established a monastery there about the year 793, and, inthe high Middle Ages, St. Alban’s ranked as the premier abbey in England. ",
        "Bede gives this account of Alban’s trial: “WhenAlban was brought in, the judge happened to be standing before an altar, offering sacrifice to demons… ‘What is your family and race?’ demanded the judge. ‘How does my family concern you?’ replied Alban; ‘If you wish to know the truth about my religion, know that I am a Christian and am ready to do a Christian’s duty.’ ‘I demand to know your name,’ insisted the judge. ‘Tell me at once.’ ‘My parents named me Alban,’ he answered, ‘and I worship and adore the living and true God, who created all things.’” "

Ordained in 1844 as a priest in the Diocese of Massachusetts, he left for England after being excluded from participating in diocesan convention. ",

He traveled extensively in the United States, urging blacks to emigrate to Liberia and to support the work of the Episcopal Church there. ",

Political opposition and a loss of funding finally forcedhim to return to the United States, where he concentrated his efforts on establishing a strong urban presence of independent black congregations that would be centers of worship, education, and social service. When Southern bishops proposed that a separate missionary district be created for black congregations, Crummell created a national convocation to defeat the proposal. The Union of Black Episcopalians is an outgrowth of that organization. ",

        "Alfred, alone of all English rulers, has been called “the Great,” because of his courage and Christian virtues. Born in 849 at Wantage, the youngest of five sons of King Aethelwulf, Alfred spent his life in a time of “battle, murder, and sudden death” during the Viking invasions and settlement in Britain. He was deeply impressed when, on a visit to Rome at the age of four, he was blessed by Pope Leo IV, and two years later, when he witnessed the marriage of Aethelwulf to a young princess of the Frankish court. Following his father’s death and the short reigns of his brothers, Alfred became King in 871. ",
        "In heroic battles and by stratagems against the Danes, Alfred halted the tide of their invasion and secured control of the southern, and part of the midland, regions of England. After a decisive victory in 878 at Edington over the Danish leader Guthrum, he persuaded his foe to accept baptism. ",
        "A man of deep piety, Alfred’s leadership in battle and administration was grounded by his faith. His biographer Asser wrote of his commitment to a life of prayer influenced by monasticism. “He learned the daily course, that is, the celebrations of the Hours, and after that certain psalms and many prayers, gathered together in one book for the sake of prayer, which he carried around with him everywhere on his person by day and night, just as we have seen, inseparable from himself, in all of the doings of this present life.” ",
        "In his later years, Alfred sought to repair the damage that the Viking invasions had inflicted upon culture and learning, especially among the parish clergy. With the help of scholars from Wales and the European continent, he supervised translations into English of important classics of theology and history, including works by Gregory the Great, Augustine of Hippo, and Bede. In one of them he commented: “He seems to me a very foolish man, and very wretched, who will not increase his understanding while he is in the world, and ever wish and long to reach that endless life where all shall be made clear.” ",

        "It is believed that the commemoration of all the saints on November 1st originated in Ireland, spread from there to England, and then to the European continent. That it had reached Rome and had been adopted there early in the ninth century is attested by a letter of Pope Gregory IV, who reigned from 828 to 844, to Emperor Louis the Pious, urging that such a festival be observed throughout the Holy Roman Empire. ",
        "However, the desire of Christian people to express the intercommunion of the living and the dead in the Body of Christ by a commemoration of those who, having professed faith in the living Christ during their lives, had entered into the nearer presence of their Lord, and especially of those who had crowned their profession with heroic deaths, was far older than the early Middle Ages. Gregory Thaumaturgus (the “Wonder Worker”), writing before the year 270, refers to the observance of a festival of all martyrs, though he does not date it. A hundred years later, Ephrem the Deacon mentionssuch an observance in Edessa on May 13th; and the patriarch John Chrysostom, who died in 407, says that a festival of All Saints was observed on the first Sunday after Pentecost in Constantinople atthe time of his episcopate. The lectionary of the East Syrians set a commemoration of all the saints on Friday in Easter week. On May 13th, in the year 610, the Pantheon in Rome—originally a pagan temple dedicated to “all the gods”—was dedicated as the Church of St. Mary and All Martyrs. ",
        "All Saints’ Day is classified in the Prayer Book as a Principal Feast, taking precedence over any other day or observance. Amongthe seven Principal Feasts, All Saints’ Day alone may be observed on the following Sunday, in addition to its observance on its fixed date. It is also one of the four days particularly recommended in the Prayer Book (page 312) for the administration of Holy Baptism. "

        "In the New Testament, the word “saints” is used to describe the entire membership of the Christian community, and in the Collect for All Saints’ Day the word “elect” is used in a similar sense. From very early times, however, the word “saint” came to be applied primarily to persons of heroic sanctity, whose deeds were recalled with gratitude and admiration by later generations. ",
        "Beginning in the tenth century, it became customary to set aside another day on which the church remembered that vast body of the faithful who, though no less members of the company of the redeemed, are unknown in the wider fellowship of the church. It was also a day for particular remembrance of family members and friends.  Although those in this wider body of the faithful are no less part of the communion of saints than those persons whose particular sanctity is celebrated on All Saints’ Day, the liturgical mood of the two days is nevertheless quite different, as the joy and exultation of All Saints’ Day transitions to the much more personal remembrances and griefs of All Souls’ Day.

        "Alhough the observance of All Souls’ Day was abolished at the Reformation because of abuses connected with masses for the dead, a renewed understanding of its meaning has led to a widespread acceptance of this commemoration among Anglicans, and to its inclusion as an optional observance in the calendar of the Episcopal Church.

He became involved in the election of a Bishop of Milan only as mediator between the battling factions of Arians and Nicene Christians. The election was important, because the victorious party would control the powerful see of Milan. ",
        "Ambrose exhorted the nearly riotous mob to keep the peace and to obey the law. Suddenly both sides raised the cry, “Ambrose shall be our bishop!” He protested, but the people persisted. Hastily baptized, he was ordained as a bishop on December 7th, 373. ",
        "Ambrose rapidly won renown as a defender of orthodoxy against Arianism and as a statesman of the church. He was also a skillful hymnodist. He introduced antiphonal chanting to enrich the liturgy and wrote straightforward, practical discourses to educate his people in such matters of doctrine as Baptism, the Trinity, the Eucharist, and the Person of Christ. His persuasive preaching was an important factor in the conversion of Augustine of Hippo. ",
        "Ambrose did not fear to rebuke emperors, including the hot-headed Theodosius, whom he forced to do public penance for the slaughter of several thousand citizens of Thessalonica. He also preached passionate sermons in defense of the poor and the needy.  In a homily on Naboth’s vineyard (1 Kings 21) he declares: “The story of Naboth is an old one, but it is repeated every day.  Who among the rich does not daily covet the goods of others?  Who among the wealthy does not make every effort to drive the poor person out from his little plot and turn the needy out from the boundaries of his ancestral fields?  Who is satisfied with what is his?  What rich person’s thoughts are not preoccupied with his neighbor’s possessions?  It is not one Ahab who was born, therefore, but— what is worse—Ahab is born every day, and never does he die as far as this world is concerned.  For each one who dies there are many others who rise up; there are more who steal property than who lose it…How far, O rich, will you extend your mad greed?” ",

Although praised for his learning and his asceticism, he is most vividly remembered for the vehemence with which he resisted ordination.",
        "Ammonius was one of four brothers who became monastic hermits in Scete in northern Egypt, disciples of the great ascetic Pambo.  Although most of the monks in that settlement were illiterate, Ammonius had been exceptionally well educated.  He is said to have had the entire Old and New Testament memorized, as well as the works of many early Christian theologians.  Although he left no writings, many of his students and colleagues did, perhaps the most famous of whom is Evagrius of Pontus.",
        "In addition to his great knowledge, Ammonius was also very strict in his spiritual practice and was well loved as a spiritual director and guide. Because of all of this, the inhabitants of a nearby village wanted him to be their bishop.  Forcible ordination was not unusual in the early church, and so Bishop Timothy of Alexandria told the people that if they were able to bring this holy man to him, he would absolutely ordain him.",
        "Ammonius pleaded with them not to do this thing, but they would not hear it, and a large crowd of them gathered to drag him back to Alexandria by force.  Seeing that they were too numerous for him to resist or to flee, Ammonius seized a sword and chopped off his ear in front of the shocked observers.  He then calmly replied that he was now utterly disqualified for ecclesiastical office since the law forbids a man who is mutilated to become a priest (Leviticus 21:16–24).  Deeply shaken, the people returned to Bishop Timothy, who told them: “This law is only observed by the Jews.  If you bring him to me, I will ordain him even if he chops off his nose too!”  ",
        "Therefore, they returned, but when they attempted to drag Ammonius off again, this time he said to them “I swear to you that if you do such a thing to me, I shall cut out my tongue as well!”  Alarmed by the prospect of losing his preaching and exhortation, they finally left him in peace.  This story was as striking in antiquity as it is today, and is recounted by a number of writers (including his disapproving bishop). Most sources refer to him as “Ammonius the Earless” from that time forth.  ",
        "Despite his strident refusal of the episcopate, Ammonius was by no means anti-clerical.  His own brother Dioscorus had become a bishop, his other two brothers were both priests, and when he left Egypt towards the end of his life during the theological controversies that had embroiled Scete, he sought out the company of his close friend John Chrysostom.  He was also a close companion and associate of Melania the Elder, welcoming her as a guest to his monastic settlement, visiting her in Jerusalem at hers, and welcoming her protege Evagrius to his community.  He died while visiting John Chrysostom sometime around the year 403."

      "bio": [
        "Anselm was born in Italy about 1033 and took monastic vows in 1060 at the Abbey of Bec in Normandy. He succeeded his teacher Lanfranc as Prior of Bec in 1063, and as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1093. His episcopate was stormy, in continual conflict with the crown over the rights and freedom of the church. His greatest talent lay in theology and spiritual direction. ",
        "As a pioneer in the scholastic method, Anselm remains the great exponent of the so-called “ontological argument” for the existence of God: God is “that than which nothing greater can be thought.” Even the fool, who (in Psalm 14) says in his heart “There is no God,” must have an idea of God in his mind, the concept of an unconditional being (ontos) than which nothing greater can be conceived; otherwise he would not be able to speak of “God” at all. And so this something, “God,” must exist outside the mind as well; because, if he did not, he would not in fact be that than which nothing greater can be thought. Since the greatest thing that can be thought must have existence as one of its properties, Anselm asserts, “God” can be said to existin reality as well as in the intellect, but is not dependent upon the material world for verification. To some, this “ontological argument” has seemed mere deductive rationalism; to others it has the merit of showing that faith in God need not be contrary to human reason. ",
        "Anselm is also the most famous exponent of the “satisfaction theory” of the atonement. Anselm explains the work of Christ in terms ofthe feudal society of his day. If a vassal breaks his bond, he has to atone for this to his lord; likewise, sin violates a person’s bond with God, the supreme Lord, and atonement or satisfaction must be made. Of ourselves, we are unable to make such atonement, because God is perfect and we are not. Therefore, God himself has saved us, becoming perfect man in Christ, so that a perfect life could be offered in satisfaction for sin. ",
        "Undergirding Anselm’s theology is a profound piety. His spiritualityis best summarized in the phrase, “faith seeking understanding.” He writes, “I do not seek to understand that I may believe, but I believe in order that I may understand. For this, too, I believe, that unless I first believe, I shall not understand.” "

        "Anskar was one of those valiant Christians of whom it might be said, “These shall plant the seed, but others shall reap the harvest.” As Archbishop of Hamburg, he was papal legate for missionary work among the Scandinavians. The immediate result of his devoted and perilous labors was minimal: two churches established on the border of Denmark and one priest settled in Sweden. He also participated in the consecration of Gotbert, first bishop in Sweden.  Nevertheless, it was the seed from which a fruitful mission would later grow.",
        "Anskar was born in the Somme region of France in 801, and educated in the outstanding monastic school in nearby Corbie Abbey. His teaching skill led him to be chosen to be sent out by Corbie as master of a new monastery school in Saxon Germany. His strongest call, however, was to be a missionary.",
        "He was stirred, his biographer Rimbert says, by a prolonged vision, in which a voice said, “Go and return to me crowned with martyrdom.” When King Harald of Denmark sought missionaries for that country in 826, Anskar was one of those selected. Rimbert notes that Anskar’s missionary purpose caused astonishment. Why should he wish to leave his brothers to deal with “unknown and barbarous folk?” Some of the brethren tried to deter him; others mocked him.",
        "Steadfast in his resolve, Anskar established a school and mission in Denmark, working conscientiously but unsuccessfully to convert and evangelize. He was not totally discouraged. Another vision appeared, with a voice saying, “Go and declare the work of God to the nations.” Shortly afterward, about 829, he was called to Sweden and eagerly accepted the invitation.  Yet meager aid both from the monastery and the emperor frustrated his efforts.",
        "While still a young man, Anskar was consecrated as Archbishop of Hamburg in 831.  He continued his work among the Scandinavians until 848, when he retired to the See of Bremen and died in 865. ",
        "The seeds of his efforts were not to bear fruit until over one hundred years later, when Viking devastation, weakness in the Frankish Church, and the lowest ebb of missionary enthusiasm came to an end. The rich harvest of conversion was three generations away. Nevertheless, Anskar is now looked upon by Scandinavians as their apostle."

        "In the third century, many Christians turned away from the corrupt and decadent society of the time and went to live in deserts or on mountains, in solitude, fasting, and prayer. Antony of Egypt was an outstanding example of this early monastic movement, but he was not merely a recluse. He is traditionally regarded as the founder of Christian monasticism because of his role as an inspirational teacher and guide, which spread the popularity of the new monastic movement considerably.",
        "Antony’s parents were Christians, and he grew up to be thoughtful, devout, and introspective. When his parents died, he and his younger sister were left alone to care for a sizable estate. Six months later, while attending church, he heard the reading about the rich young man whom Christ directed to sell all that he had and give to the poor.  Hearing his own call from God through this scripture, Antony at once gave his land to the villagers and sold most of his goods, giving the proceeds to the poor. ",
        "Later, after meditating on Christ’s exhortation, “Do not be anxious about tomorrow,” he sold what remained of his possessions, placed his sister in a “house of virgins,” and became an anchorite (solitary ascetic).  The vocational path taken by Antony’s sister is one of many indications that, although Antony has traditionally been known as the founder of monasticism, some forms of urban monastic life (particularly for women) existed even before his call to undertake a monastic vocation in the solitude of the desert. ",
        "Athanasius, whose work The Life of Antony quickly spread Antony’s fame far beyond Egypt, writes that Antony spent his days praying, reading, and doing manual labor. For a time, he was tormented by temptations and demons in various guises, but he resisted, and the demons fled. Moving to the mountains across the Nile from his village, Antony dwelt alone for twenty years. In 305, he left his cave and founded an early form of monastic communal life– a collection of cells inhabited by ascetics living under his guidance. Athanasius writes of such colonies: “Their cells, like tents, were filled with singing, fasting, praying, and working so that they might give alms, and they had love and peace with one another.” ",
        "Athanasius further said of Antony: “He was like a physician given by God to Egypt. For who met him grieving and did not go away rejoicing? Who came full of anger and was not turned to kindness?... What monk who had grown slack was not strengthened by coming to him? Who came troubled by doubts and failed to gain peace of mind?” Antony died in 356. "

She became the first published Protestant woman writer, and participated publicly in the theological and political debates of her time.",
        "Argula was born in 1492 into a noble family in the Bavarian countryside. When she was ten, her father presented her with an illustrated copy of the German Bible—a lavish gift which seems to have made an impression on the young Argula. Her education continued when she was a lady-in-waiting at the court, in a time when renaissance and reform were stirring the air in Munich and Germany.",
        "Her parents died when she was 17; she married at 18 and moved to another country town, where she managed the household, finances, and land; bore, raised, and oversaw the education of four children; and pursued her interests in theology.",
        "Argula took on a more public role when, in September of 1523, she learned that the theologians at the nearby University of Ingolstadt had forced a young Lutheran tutor to recant his beliefs in public. He was saved from burning at the stake, but was to be exiled and imprisoned. Argula wrote a letter to these clerics, accusing them of “foolish violence against the word of God,” and notes that “nowhere in the Bible do I find that Christ, or his apostles, or his prophets put people in prison, burnt or murdered them, or sent them into exile.” She defends the writings of “Martin and Melancthon,” which she has read, and decries the University’s failed attempts to hide the truth of these reformers and of Scripture. ",
        "Despite her being a lay person and a woman, she says she is compelled to speak by her divine duty as a Christian to confess God’s name (she quotes Matthew 10) and to be unashamed of Christ (Luke 9). Her knowledge of Scripture and artful use of it was striking to her readers of the time, and is striking now. Her letter is a variegated composition with textures from across the Bible, picking up Gospels, Psalms, and prophets to form the skeleton and teeth of her impassioned arguments. ",
        "She closes by saying, “What I have written to you is no woman’s chit-chat, but the word of God; and (I write) as a member of the Christian Church, against which the gates of Hell cannot prevail.” Her letter was immediately printed as a pamphlet, which was then reprinted in fourteen editions over two months. More pamphlets, letters, and poems followed, and consequences followed too. However, she did not seem ever to regret that she—like her beloved forebears Judith, Esther, and Jael—had been called by God into decisive action. "

He quickly attracted attention by his opposition to the presbyter Arius, whose teaching that the Second Person of the Trinity was a creature was gaining widespread acceptance. Alexander, the Bishop of Alexandria, took Athanasius as his secretary and adviser to the first Ecumenical Council, at Nicaea in 325, which dealt with the Arian conflict. Athanasius was successful in winning approval for the phrase in the Nicene Creed which has ever since been recognized as expressing unequivocally the full divinity of the Son: “of one Being with the Father” (homoousios). ",
        "When Alexander died in 328, Athanasius became bishop. He fearlessly defended Nicene Christology against emperors, magistrates, bishops, and theologians. Five times he was sentinto exile. He often seemed to stand alone for the orthodox faith. “Athanasius contra mundum” (Athanasius against the world) became a by-word. Yet, by the time of his last exile, his popularity among the citizens of Alexandria was so great that the emperor had to recall him to avoid insurrection in the city.  ",
        "Athanasius wrote extensively, including biblical interpretation, theological exposition, sermons, and letters. His treatise, On the Incarnation of the Word of God, is a still widely read theological classic, and his work The Life of Antony became profoundly influential in the spread of the early monastic movement.

He became himself an object for the senses, so that those who were seeking God in sensible things might apprehend the Father through the works which he, the Word of God, did in the body. Human and human-minded as people were, therefore, to whichever side they looked in the sensible world, they found themselves taught the truth.” ",

        "Although Christianity had existed in Britain before the invasionsof Angles and Saxons in the 5th century, Pope Gregory the Great decided in 596 to send a mission to the pagan Anglo-Saxons. He selected, from his own monastery on the Coelian hill in Rome, a group of monks, led by their prior, Augustine. They arrived in Kent in 597, carrying a silver cross and an image of Jesus Christ painted on a board, which thus became, so far as we know, “Canterbury’s first icon.” ",
        "King Ethelbert tolerated their presence and allowed them the use of an old church built on the east side of Canterbury, dating from the Roman occupation of Britain. Here, says Bede, they assembled “to sing the psalms, to pray, to say Mass, to preach, and to baptize.” This church of St. Martin is the earliest place of Christian worship in England still in use. ",
        "Probably in 601, Ethelbert was converted, thus becoming the first Christian king in England. Around the same time, Augustine was ordained as a bishop somewhere in France and named “Archbishop of the English Nation.” Thus, the see of Canterbury and its Cathedral Church of Christ owe their establishment to Augustine’s mission, as does the nearby Abbey of Saints Peter and Paul, later re-named for Augustine. The “chair of St. Augustine” in Canterbury Cathedral, however, dates from the thirteenth century. ",
        "Some correspondence between Augustine and Gregory survives.One of the Pope’s most famous counsels to the first Archbishop of Canterbury has to do with diversity in the young English church. Gregory writes, “If you have found customs, whether in the Roman, Gallican, or any other churches that may be more acceptable to God, I wish you to make a careful selection of them, and teach the church of the English, which is still young in the faith, whatever you can profitably learn from the various churches. For things should not be loved for the sake of places, but places for the sake of good things.” This counsel bears on the search for Christian “unity in diversity” of the ecumenical movement of today.

      "bio": [
        "Augustine, perhaps the most influential theologian in the history of Western Christianity, was born in 354 at Tagaste in North Africa. In his restless search for truth, he was attracted by Manichaeism and Neoplatonism, and was constantly engaged in an inner struggle against sin. Finally, under the influence of his mother Monica, Augustine surrendered to the Christian faith in the late summer of 386. He was baptized by Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, on Easter Eve in 387. After returning to North Africa in 391, Augustine found himself chosen by the people of Hippo to be a priest. Four years later he was chosen bishop of that city. His spiritual autobiography, The Confessions, written shortly before 400 in the form of an extended prayer, is a classic of Western spirituality.  He famously wrote, “You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in you.”",
        "Augustine wrote countless treatises, letters, and sermons. They have provided a rich source of new and fresh insights into Christian truth, and became foundational of later Christian theology as it developed in the Western church.",
        "Much of Augustine’s theology developed in dialogue with those he disagreed with, and his training in rhetoric is on full display.  The Manichaeans had attempted to solve the problem of evil by positing the existence of an independent agent eternally opposed to God. In refutation, Augustine affirmed that all creation is essentially good, having been created by God, and that evil is, properly speaking, the privation of good. A rigorist sect, the Donatists, had split from the rest of the church after the persecution of Diocletian in the early fourth century. Against them, Augustine asserted that the church was “holy,” not because its members could be proved holy, but because holiness was a property of the church, to which all its members are called. ",
        "Stirred by Alaric the Visigoth’s sack of Rome in 410, Augustine wrote his great work, The City of God. In it he writes: “Two cities have been formed by two loves: the earthly by love of self, even to the contempt of God, the heavenly by the love of God, even to the contempt of self. The earthly city glories in itself, the heavenly city glories in the Lord…In the one, the princes, and the nations it subdues, are ruled by the love of ruling; in the other, the princes and the subjects serve one another in love.” ",
        "Augustine died on August 28th, 430, as the Vandals were besieging his own earthly city of Hippo. "

The girl was so traumatized by the experience that she was unable to remember her name. Bakhita means “fortunate one” - a name given her by the same slave raiders that forcefully removed her from her family and village. Even as a child, she said that she experienced God in her heart without ever having been evangelized. She said, “Seeing the sun, the moon and the stars, I said to myself: Who could be the Master of these beautiful things? And I felt a great desire to see him, to know him and to pay him homage.” ",
        "Although technically illegal, the entire Sudan region in the late 19th century was a raiding ground for various groups of armed slave traders. Enslaved for 12 years, she endured untold hardship and suffering. She was resold several times, finally in 1883 to the Italian consul in Khartoum, Sudan. After he gave her to his friend Augusto Michieli, she went with him and his family to Italy where she worked as a nanny for their young daughter, Mimmina. Accompanying the girl to Venice’s Institute of the Catechumens, Josephine found herself drawn to Christianity. She was baptized as Josephine in 1890. ",
        "The hardships in her life meant that Josephine did not easily express her joy. But she often expressed the joy she experienced through Christ at the font where she was baptized, kissing it and saying: “Here I became one of the daughters of God!”",

She soon became well loved by the children attending the sisters’ school and by the local citizens. By the end of her life, Josephine was renowned across Italy for her loving, spiritual wisdom.",
        "Josephine knew the reality of being a slave, an immigrant, and a spiritual seeker. Even today, countless children, women, and men continue to be victimized, and trafficked into slavery. Josephine serves as an inspiration to those who work to free girls and women from oppression and violence, and to return them to their dignity in the full exercise of their rights. Not only is she a model of resistance, Josephine also reminds us of our obligation to strive against the evil and injustice of human trafficking and uphold the dignity of every human person."

        "Benedict is generally considered the father of Western monasticism. He was born around 480, at Nursia in central Italy, and was educated at Rome. Rome at this time was in the midst of considerable political and social instability. Benedict’s disapproval of the manners and morals of his society led him to a vocation of ascetic renunciation. He withdrew to a hillside cave above Lake Subiaco,about forty miles west of Rome, where there was already at least one other hermit. ",
        "Gradually, after many setbacks and considerable opposition, a community grew up around Benedict. Sometime between 525 and 530, he moved south with some of his disciples to Monte Cassino, midway between Rome and Naples, where he established another community, and, around 540, composed his famous monastic Rule. He died sometime between 540 and 550 and was buried in the same grave as his sister, Scholastica. ",
        "It has been said that no personality or text in the history of monasticism has occasioned more studies than Benedict and his rule. The major problem for historians is the question of how much of the rule is original. This is closely related to the question of the date of another, very similar but anonymous, rule for monks, known as The Rule of the Master, which may antedate Benedict’s Rule by ten years. This does not detract from the fact that Benedict’s firm but reasonable rule has been the basic source document from which most subsequent Western monastic rules were derived. Its average day provides for a little over four hours to be spent in liturgical prayer, a little over five hours in spiritual reading, about six hours of work, one hour for eating, and about eight hours of sleep. The entire Psalter is to be recited in the Divine Office once every week.   At profession, the new monk or nun takes vows of “stability, conversion of life, and obedience.” ",
        "The prologue to the Rule says: “And so we are going to establish a school for the service of the Lord. In founding it we hope to introduce nothing harsh or burdensome. But if a certain strictness results from the dictates of equity for the amendment of vices or the preservation of charity, do not be at once dismayed and fly from the way of salvation, whose entrance cannot but be narrow (Matthew 7:14).  For as we advance in the religious life and in faith, our hearts expand and we run the way of God’s commandments with unspeakable sweetness of love.  Thus, never departing from his school, but persevering in the monastery according to his teaching until death, we may by patience share in the sufferings of Christ (1 Peter 4:13) and deserve to have a share also in his kingdom.”",

He also adopted Benedictine monasticism as an instrument of evangelization when, in 596, he sent Augustine and his companions to convert the Anglo-Saxon people.

        "By 1140, his writings had made him one of the most influential figures in Christendom. His guidance was sought by prelates and princes, drawing him into active participation in all manner of controversy involving the church, from settling disputes among secular rulers to sorting contentious theological debates. An ardent opponent of a growing movement of his time to reconcile inconsistencies of doctrine by reason, he felt that such an approach was a downgrading ofthe mysteries. This conflict took particular expression in his fierce opposition to the formidable theologian, Abelard. ",
        "Among Bernard’s writings are treatises on humility and pride, on love, on the veneration of Mary, and a commentary on the Song of Songs. Among well known hymns, he is credited with having written “O sacred head sore wounded” (The Hymnal 1982, #168; #169), “Jesus, the very thought of thee” (#642) and “O Jesus, joy of loving hearts” (#649; #650).  He died on August 20th, 1153."

        "Birgitta Birgersdotter came from a noble Swedish family and was born in 1303. Early in her life she discerned a religious vocation, but was married against her will at the age of 13 to a member of the Swedish nobility. The couple had eight children. Birgitta sought to live a holy, religious life. When her husband was absent, she openly practiced a strict asceticism, and when he was home, she did so secretly. Both she and her husband became members of the Franciscan Third Order, which admitted laypeople.",
        "From childhood, Birgitta had experienced visions. Christ, Mary, and the saints spoke with her often in Swedish and shared with her warnings intended for others, which Birgitta would write down or dictate to her confessor. Eventually these messages became increasingly political, which caused her great discomfort. Although Birgitta enjoyed a good relationship with the royal family, she sharply criticized the king, becoming a symbolic leader for the aristocratic Swedish opposition. ",
        "Birgitta advised popes and rulers throughout Europe, and criticized the extravagant lifestyles of the clergy, monastic orders, and laity, challenging four popes to return to Rome from Avignon. She also tried to persuade the rulers of England and France to negotiate peace and end the war that would later be called the Hundred Years’ War. Because of her struggles, she was recognized throughout Europe as an uncomfortable counselor and a visionary.",
        "After the death of her husband in 1344, Birgitta devoted herself entirely to the religious life. The Order she founded, the Brigittines, was based on the revelations she had received earlier in her life. Her monastery would always have a women’s and men’s cloister next to one another, joined by a shared church, in which the monks, nuns, and laity would pray together. The abbess would be in charge of both the men’s and women’s cloister. To get papal approval for her order’s founding, Birgitta traveled to Rome. In 1370, Urban V recognized the new order and allowed its foundation at Vadstena, Sweden. Birgitta was, in fact, not the first abbess there, but rather her daughter Catherine. ",
        "Except for several pilgrimages, Birgitta remained in Rome for the rest of her life. She ministered to both rich and poor, sheltered the homeless, and worked untiringly for the return of the pope from Avignon to Rome. In 1372, she was spurred by a vision to visit the Holy Land. On the return trip from Jerusalem Birgitta fell ill and entered eternal life on July 23rd, 1373.  In Sweden she is celebrated on October 7th, which is the anniversary of her canonization."

        "In the second century, after a brief respite, Christians in many parts of the Roman empire were once again subjected to persecution. At Lyons and Vienne, in Gaul, there were missionary centers which had drawn many Christians from Asia and Greece. They were living a devout life under the guidance of Pothinus, the elderly Bishop of Lyons, when persecution began in 177.",
        "At first, the Christians were socially excluded from Roman homes, the public baths, and the market place; insults, stones, and blows were rained on them by pagan mobs, and Christian homes were vandalized. Soon after, the imperial officials forced Christians to come to the marketplace for harsh questioning, followed by imprisonment.",
        "Some slaves from Christian households were tortured to extract public accusations that Christians practiced cannibalism, incest, and other perversions. These false accusations roused the mob to such a pitch of wrath that any leniency toward the imprisoned Christians was impossible. Even friendly pagans now turned against them.",
        "The fury of the mob fell most heavily on Sanctus, a deacon; Attalus; Maturus, a recent convert; and Blandina, a slave. According to Eusebius, Blandina was so filled with power to withstand torments that her torturers gave up. “I am a Christian,” she said, “and nothing vile is done among us.” Sanctus was tormented with red-hot irons. The aged Pothinus, badly beaten, died soon after. Finally, the governor decided to set aside several days for a public spectacle in the amphitheater.",
        "Eusebius depicts Blandina in particular as standing in the person of Christ: “Blandina was suspended on a stake, and exposed to be devoured by the wild beasts who should attack her. And because she appeared as if hanging on a cross, and because of her earnest prayers, she inspired the combatants with great zeal. For they looked on her in her conflict, and beheld with their outward eyes, in the form of their sister, him who was crucified for them, that he might persuade those who believe in him that every one who suffers for the glory of Christ has fellowship always with the living God.”",
        "On the final day of the spectacle, writes Eusebius, “Blandina, last of all, like a noble mother who had encouraged her children and sent them ahead victorious to the King, hastened to join them.” Beaten, torn, burned with irons, she was wrapped in a net and tossed about by a wild bull. The spectators were amazed at her endurance.",
        "Eusebius concludes: “They offered up to the Father a single wreath, but it was woven of diverse colors and flowers of all kinds. It was fitting that the noble athletes should endure a varied conflict, and win a great victory, that they might be entitled in the end to receive the crown supreme of life everlasting.”"

In 719 he started out again, but this time he first went to Rome to seek papal approval. Pope Gregory II commissioned him to work in Germany, and gave him the name of Boniface.",
        "For the rest of his days, Boniface devoted himself to reforming, planting, and organizing churches, monasteries, and dioceses in Hesse, Thuringia, and Bavaria. Many helpers and supplies came to him from friends in England. In 722 the Pope ordained him as a bishop, ten years later made him an archbishop, and in 743 gave him a fixed see at Mainz.",
        "The Frankish rulers also supported his work. At their invitation, he presided over reforming councils of the Frankish Church, and in 752, with the consent of Pope Zacharias, he anointed Pepin (Pippin) as King of the Franks. Thus, the way was prepared for Charlemagne, son of Pepin, and the revival of a unified Christian dominion in western Europe.",
        "In 753 Boniface resigned his see in order to spend his last years again as a missionary in Frisia. On June 5th, 754, while awaiting a group of converts for confirmation, he and his companions were murdered by a band of pagans, near Dokkum. His body was buried at Fulda, a monastery he had founded in 744, near Mainz."

Her father Dubhthach was the poet laureate of King Loeghaire and a pagan, but her mother Brocca was a Christian. ",
        "Even as a young girl, Brigid was notorious for giving away all of the family’s food and goods in order to feed and assist the poor.  Enraged, her father tried to sell her to the king of Leinster, but even while the two men were negotiating her price, she took her father’s jeweled sword and gave it to a beggar so that he could sell it to feed his family.  The king was impressed with her compassion and resourcefulness, and offered Dubhthach his own jeweled sword as a replacement, telling him to give his daughter her freedom.",

Tosecure the sacraments, Brigid persuaded the anchorite Conlaed to receive ordination as a bishop and to bring his community of monks to Kildare, thus establishing a double monastery for both men and women. She also founded a renowned scriptorium and center for manuscript illumination at the monastic community.",

        "Catherine of Alexandria, Barbara of Nicomedia, and Margaret of Antioch were three of the most popular ancient and medieval saints, and they even attracted widespread devotion among Anglicans after the Reformation.  In the mid-twentieth century, however, their popularity waned significantly as doubts about this historicity grew.  The lives of all three virgin martyrs contain many elements that are indisputably either legendary or metaphorical.  In recent decades, however, martyrdom accounts written in such a style have attracted increased scholarly attention as we have started to ponder the particular ways in which communities choose to remember trauma.  It is striking, for example, that virtually no female martyrdom accounts include sexual violence, even though we know from other genres of writing that it was historically very common.  Whatever is happening in these accounts, it is clearly not a straightforward description of the facts, but seems to be rather a recasting of trauma into something that one might actually want to remember and feel inspired by, and the kind of stories that one could pass on to one’s children.  In the world of historical facts, we all know that instruments of torture do not spontaneously shatter and that dragons do not explode.  (For that matter, we know that there are no dragons to begin with!)  But if the purpose of such narratives is not to convey the literal truth of what happened, but rather to portray the unvanquished spirits of these early Christian martyrs in the face of trauma, then perhaps there may be a kind of truth behind the legends after all.",
        "According to the life of Catherine of Alexandria, she was a young scholar and the daughter of an Egyptian government official who converted to Christianity as a teenager.  When she rebuked the emperor for his cruelty in inciting persecution against the Christians, he summoned 50 of his best philosophers and orators to debate with her, but she won every single argument and many of them were converted to Christianity.  The emperor then condemned her to be tortured to death on a spiked wheel, but it shattered at her touch.  Finally, he had her beheaded.",
        "Barbara’s life states that because of her beauty, her father locked her up in a tower where only her pagan tutors were granted access to her. From them she became highly educated and began to consider the nature of the physical and metaphysical world, and eventually decided that there was only one true God, and that it might be the God of the Christians.  She had a third window added to her prison, and thus created place of personal prayer where she could contemplate the Trinity as the light moved across the three windows. When her father questioned this action, she professed her Christian faith to him and was executed.",
        "The life of Margaret of Antioch recounts that she was the daughter of a pagan priest named Aedesius.  Her mother died in childbirth, and so she was given to a Christian woman to nurse, and as she grew up she embraced the Christian religion.  When her religion became known, she was subjected to severe persecutions, the most famous trial included being swallowed by Satan in the form of a dragon.  The cross that she was holding in her hand irritated the dragon’s stomach, however, and caused it to immediately explode.  Eventually, after prevailing through many trials, she was executed.  Margaret was one of the most popular English saints, both before and after the Reformation.  Many Anglican parishes have been dedicated to her, as has the women’s religious community the Society of Saint Margaret."

Her writings became widely known when they were made the subject of Baron Friedrich von Hügel's classic work The Mystical Element of Religion (1908).",
        "Catherine was born in Genoa, Italy, in 1447, the youngest of five children.  As a teenager, Catherine wanted to become a nun, but her application to the convent was denied.  Instead, she was married at the age of 16 to Giuliano Adorno as part of an attempt to end the feud between their two families.  The couple were initially miserable together.  Giuliano was angry, unfaithful, and lost most of their money through gambling and reckless spending.  Catherine spent the first ten years of her marriage in a deep depression, praying that God would strike her with a great sickness so that she could remain in bed all day.",
        "The trajectory of her life was changed on March 22nd, 1473 when she had a sudden mystical experience.  While she was in church, in the middle of making her confession to a priest, she was suddenly struck with an overpowering sense of the overwhelming love of God.  She was so stunned and dazed by this experience that she walked out of the church without even completing her confession.  This was the beginning of a life of profound prayer.",
        "Catherine combined a deep and intense contemplative life with an active dedication to caring for the sick in the local hospital.  In time, her husband joined her in this work, and the couple became increasingly close to one another through their shared labor for those in need.  They eventually moved together into the Pannatome, a large hospital in Genoa, in order to devote themselves completely to caring for the sick there.  There Catherine also dictated a number of works of mystical theology, which were published some 40 years after her death.  ",
        "Catherine insisted that God should be loved only for God’s self, and not for anything that one might expect to receive from him, insisting that “Pure Love loves God without any for.” She also wrote: “All that I have said is nothing compared to what I feel within, the witnessed correspondence of love between God and the soul; for when God sees the soul, as pure as it was in its origins, he tugs at it with a glance, draws it and binds it to himself with a fiery love that by itself could annihilate the immortal soul.” ",

After training as a career army officer, Charles served in Algeria and Tunisia until he resigned his commission in 1882. He then became an explorer in Morocco. There he encountered devout Muslims, whose practice of their faith inspired Charles to begin a search for the faith that was his own.

When General Pershing was given the command in 1917, he asked Brent to organize the chaplaincy for the force and then persuaded him to stay on to run the organization he had created, a first for the US Army in terms of scale and centralization, and the precedent for the creation of the post of Chief of Chaplains in 1920. In 1918, he accepted election as Bishop of Western New York, having declined three previous elections in order to remain at his post in the Philippines.",
        "Brent was the outstanding figure of the Episcopal Church on the world scene for two decades. The central focus of his life and ministry was the cause of Christian unity. After attending the World Missionary Conference in Edinburgh in 1910, he led the Episcopal Church in the movement that culminated in the first World Conference on Faith and Order, which was held in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1927, and over which he presided. He died in 1929 and is buried in the main cemetery in Lausanne in the section reserved for “honored foreigners;” his tomb is still often visited and adorned with commemorative plaques brought by delegations from the Philippines.",
        "The historian James Thayer Addison described Brent as “a saint of disciplined mental vigor, one whom soldiers were proud to salute and whom children were happy to play with, who could dominate a parliament and minister to an invalid, a priest and bishop who gloried in the heritage of his church, yet who stood among all Christian brothers as one who served…He was everywhere an ambassador of Christ.”",
        "Brent was also a man of prayer. One of his prayers for the mission of the church has been included in the Book of Common Prayer: “Lord Jesus Christ, you stretched out your arms of love on the hard wood of the cross that everyone might come within the reach of your saving embrace: So clothe us with your Spirit that we, reaching forth our hands in love, may bring those who do not know you to the knowledge and love of you; for the honor of your Name.”"

        "The historian Thomas Macaulay said about Charles Simeon, “If you knew what his authority and influence were, and how they extended from Cambridge to the most remote corners of England, you would allow that his real sway in the Church was far greater than that of any primate.” ",
        "Simeon’s conversion in 1779, while he was still a student, occurred as he was preparing himself to receive Holy Communion, an act required of undergraduates at the University. His first Communion hadbeen a deeply depressing and discouraging experience because ofhis use of the popular devotional tract, The Whole Duty of Man, which emphasized law and obedience as the means of receiving the Sacrament worthily. When he was again preparing for Communion before Easter, he was given a copy of Bishop Thomas Wilson’s Instructions for the Lord’s Supper. Here was a very different approach, which recognized that the law could not make one righteous and that only the sacrifice of Christ, perceived by faith, could enable one to communicate worthily. This time, the experience of Holy Communion was one of peace and exhilaration, a new beginning in a Christian life whose influence would be difficult to exaggerate. ",
        "In 1782, the year of his graduation from King’s College, Cambridge, he was placed in charge of Trinity Church in that city, while still a deacon. He remained as rector there for 54 years, despite intense early opposition from the churchwardens and congregation over his evangelical preaching. ",
        "Simeon’s influence and authority developed slowly, but he eventually became the recognized leader of the evangelical movement in the Church of England. He helped to found the Church Missionary Society and was active in recruiting and supporting missionaries, including Henry Martyn. As a preacher, he ranks high in the history of Anglicanism. His sermons were unfailingly biblical, simple, and passionate. ",
        "The influence of Simeon and his friends was thus described by the historian William Edward Hartpole Lecky: “They gradually changed the whole spirit of the English Church. They infused into it a new fire and passion of devotion, kindled a spirit of fervent philanthropy, raised the standard of clerical duty, and completely altered the whole tone and tendency of the preaching of its ministers.” ",
        "Simeon died on November 13th, 1836, in Cambridge, and was buried at King’s College. "

        "In the latter part of the twelfth century, many Christians felt that the church had fallen on evil days and was weak and spiritually impoverished. It was then that Francis of Assisi renounced his wealth and established the mendicant order of Franciscans. At the first gathering of the order in 1212, Francis preached a sermon that was to make a radical change in the life of an eighteen-year-old young woman named Clare Offreduccio. ",
        "The daughter of a wealthy family, Clare was inspired by Francis’ words with the desire to serve God and to give her life to the following of Christ’s teaching. She sought out Francis and begged that she might become a member of his order, placing her jewelry and rich outer garments on the altar as an offering. Francis could not refuse her pleas. He placed her temporarily in a nearby Benedictine convent.  When this action became known, friends and relatives tried to take Clare home again, but she remained adamant. She prevailed, and soon after was taken by Francis to a poor dwelling beside the Church of St. Damian at Assisi. Several other women soon joined her. She became the Superior of the order, which was called the “Poor Ladies of St. Damian,” and, after her death, the “Poor Clares” in tribute to her. ",
        "The order’s practices were austere. They embraced the Franciscan rule of absolute poverty. Their days were given over to begging and to works of mercy for the poor and the neglected. Clare herself was servant, not only to the poor, but to her nuns. Her biographer says that she “radiated a spirit of fervor so strong that it kindled those who but heard her voice.”",
        "Clare governed her community for 40 years, and outlived Francis by 27 years.  After the death of Francis, the order that he had founded quickly began to relax its discipline of strict poverty, and it was Clare and the other sisters who continually urged the brothers to persevere in the commitment that they had made.  She resisted several attempts by successive popes to impose a more traditional Benedictine rule on the sisters, since the discipline followed by her community was considered to be too austere for women.  When Pope Gregory IX tried to absolve her from the obligation to follow the strict poverty of her rule, Clare replied: “I need to be absolved from my sins, not from the obligation of following Christ.”  Ultimately, her community and its rule were recognized by the church as a legitimate expression of religious life for women. ",
        "In 1253, her last illness began. Daily she weakened, and daily she was visited by devoted people, by priests, and even by the pope. On her last day, as she saw many weeping by her bedside, she exhorted them to love “holy poverty” and to share their possessions. She was heard to say: “Go forth in peace, for you have followed the good road. Go forth without fear, for he that created you has sanctified you, has always protected you, and loves you as a mother. Blessed be God, for having created me.” "

Clement succeeded Pantaneaus as head ofthat school in about 190, and was for many years an apologist forthe Christian faith to both pagans and Christians. His learning and allegorical exegesis of the Bible helped to commend Christianity to the intellectual circles of Alexandria. His work prepared the way for his pupil Origen, the most eminent theologian of early Greek Christianity. During the persecution under the Emperor Severus in 202, he left Alexandria, possibly for Jerusalem or Cappadocia. The exact time and place of his death are unknown. ",
        "Clement lived in the age of “Gnosticism,” a comprehensive term for many theories or ways of salvation current in the second and third centuries, all emphasizing “Gnosis” or “knowledge.” Salvation,for Gnostics, was to be had through a secret and rather esoteric knowledge accessible only to a few. It was salvation from the world, rather than the salvation of the world. Clement asserted that there was a true Christian Gnosis, to be found in the Scriptures, available to all. Although his understanding of this Christian knowledge—ultimately knowledge of Christ—incorporated several tenets of Greek philosophy that the Gnostics also held, Clement dissented from their negative view of the world and their denial of the role of free will.

        "The occasion of the letter was the action of a younger group at Corinth, who had deposed the elder clergy because of dissatisfaction with their ministrations. The unity of the Church was being jeopardized by a dispute over its ministry. Clement’s letter sets forth a hierarchical view of Church authority. It insists that God requires due order in all things, that the deposed clergy must be reinstated, and that the legitimate superiors must be obeyed.",
        "The letter used the terms “bishop” and “presbyter” interchangeably to describe the higher ranks of clergy, but refers to some of them as “rulers” of the Church. It is they who lead its worship and “offer the gifts” of the Eucharist, just as the duly appointed priests of the Old Testament performed the various sacrifices and liturgies in their time.",

The text of First Clement was lost to the western Church in the Middle Ages, and was not rediscovered until 1628.",
        "Clement writes: “The apostles received the Gospel for us from the Lord Jesus Christ; Jesus the Christ was sent from God. Thus Christ is from God and the apostles from Christ. In both instances, the orderly procedure depends on God’s will. So thereafter, when the apostles had been given their instructions, and all their doubts had been set at rest by the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, they went forth in the confidence of the Holy Spirit to preach the Good News of the coming of God’s kingdom. They preached in country and city, and appointed their first converts, after testing them by the Spirit, to be the bishops and deacons of future believers.”"

        "Lewis did not always believe this. Born in Belfast on November 29th, 1898, Lewis was raised as an Anglican but rejected Christianity during his adolescent years. After serving in World War I, he started a long academic career as a scholar in medieval and renaissance literature at both Oxford and Cambridge. He also began an inner journey that led him from atheism to agnosticism to theism and finally to faith in Jesus Christ. ",
        "“Really, a young Atheist cannot guard his faith too carefully,” helater wrote of his conversion to theism in Surprised by Joy. “Dangers lie in wait for him on every side…Amiable agnostics will talk cheerfully about ‘man’s search for God’. To me, as I then was, they might as well have talked about the mouse’s search for the cat. You must picture me all alone in that room at Magdalen, night after night, feeling, whenever my mind lifted even for a second from my work,the steady, unrelenting approach of Him whom I so earnestly desired not to meet. That which I greatly feared had at last come upon me.In the Trinity Term of 1929 I gave in, and admitted that God was God, and knelt and prayed: perhaps, that night, the most dejected and reluctant convert in all England.” Two years later, his conversion was completed: “I know very well when, but hardly how, the final step was taken. I was driven to Whipsnade one sunny morning. When we set out, I did not believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and when we reached the zoo, I did.” ",

Bede says that he was accustomed to make visitations even to remote villages to preach to people who, “neglecting the sacrament of their creed, had recourse to idolatrous remedies; as ifby charms or amulets, or any other mysteries of the magical art, they were able to avert a stroke inflicted upon them by the Lord...”Bede says that Cuthbert “often remained a week, sometimes two or three, even a whole month, without returning home; but dwelling among the mountains, taught the poor people, both by words of his preaching, and also by his own holy conduct.” ",

Nonetheless, he kept in touch with his church by letter, and directed it with wisdom and compassion. In the controversy over what to do with those who had lapsed during the persecution, Cyprian held that they could be reconciled to the Church after suitable periods of penance, the gravity of the lapse determining the length of the penance. His moderate position was the one that generally prevailed in the church, over that of the rigorist Novatian, who led a group into schism at Rome and Antioch over this question.

        "Damien was among the first priests to arrive in Kalawao, and he remained there for the rest of his life, building houses, an orphanage, a church, and a hospital. He ate with those he served, worshipped with them, and invited them into his home. He eventually contracted leprosy, later known as Hansen’s disease, and died in 1889. ",

She entered the Sisters of St. Francis in Syracuse, New York, in 1862, and in 1870, she began work as a nurse and administrator at St. Joseph’s Hospital in Syracuse, where she was criticized for accepting alcoholics and other undesirable patients. ",
        "In 1883, she received a letter from a priest in Hawaii asking for help managing the hospitals and ministry to leprosy patients. She arrived in Honolulu in 1883 and immediately took over supervision of the Kaka’ako Branch Hospital, which served as a receiving center for leprosy patients from all over the islands. She also opened a care center for the healthy children of leprosy victims. ",
        "In 1884, she met Father Damien, and in 1886, she alone ministered to him when his illness made him unwelcome among church and government leaders. She continued her work with hospitals and sufferers of Hansen’s disease until her death in 1918. "

        "David was born around the year 500 in Menevia.  Little is knownof his early life, but, while still fairly young, he founded a monastery near Menevia and became its abbot.  He is said to have been strict in governing of his own monastery, yet loving in his treatment and correction of wrongdoers. He required monks to pull ploughs themselves rather than relying on animal labor, and to spend every evening in spiritual reading and writing.  No personal possessions were permitted, and to even say “my book” or “my robe” were offenses, since monks had only the use of those things, not the possession of them.  One of his nicknames, “the Waterman,” may indicate that he allowed the monks in his care to drink only water at meals instead of the customary wine or mead. ",
        "David’s strongest desire was to study and meditate in the quiet of his monastery, but he was virtually dragged to an assembly of bishops called to combat the heresy of Pelagianism. Once there, David proved to be so eloquent and learned that Archbishop Dubricius chose him as his own successor as Primate of Wales. In time, David founded eleven other monasteries in Wales and made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem.",
        "A scholar, a competent administrator, and a man of moderation, David filled the offices he held with distinction. He became a leader and guardian of the Christian faith in Wales. Eventually, he moved the center of episcopal government to Menevia, which is still an episcopal city, now called Ty-Dewi (House of David). "

The title is an apt one, for this apostle of Christ to the Cheyenne was originally a soldier who fought against the United States government with warriors of other tribes in the disputes over Indian land rights. Born around the year 1851, by the late 1860s Oakerhater had distinguished himself for bravery and leadership as an officer in an elite corps of Cheyenne fighters. ",
        "In 1875, after a year of minor uprisings and threats of major violence, he and twenty-seven other warrior leaders were taken prisoner by the U.S. Army, charged with inciting rebellion, and sent to a disused military prison in Florida. Under the influence of a concerned Army captain, who sought to educate the prisoners, Oakerhater and his companions learned English, gave art and archery lessons to the area’s many visitors, and had their first encounter with the Christian faith. The captain’s example, and that of other concerned Christians from as far away as New York, had a profound effect on the young warrior. He was moved to answer the call to transform his leadership in war into a lifelong ministry of peace. ",
        "With sponsorship from the Diocese of Central New York and financial help from a Mrs. Pendleton of Cincinnati, he and three other prisoners went north to study for the ministry. At his baptism in Syracuse in 1878, he took the name David Pendleton Oakerhater, in honor of his benefactress. Soon after his ordination to the diaconate in 1881, Oakerhater returned to Oklahoma. There, he was instrumental in founding and operating schools and missions, through great personal sacrifice and often inthe face of apathy from the church hierarchy and resistance from the government. He continued his ministry of service, education, and pastoral care among his people until his death on August 31st, 1931. ",

        "Dietrich Bonhoeffer was born in Breslau, Germany (now Wroclaw, Poland) on February 4th, 1906. He studied theology at the universities of Berlin and Tübingen, and his doctoral thesis was published in 1930 as Communio Sanctorum.  Still canonically too young to be ordained at the age of 24, he undertook postdoctoral study and teaching at Union Theological Seminary in New York City.",
        "From the first days of the Nazi accession to power in 1933, Bonhoeffer was involved in protests against the regime. From 1933 to 1935 he was the pastor of two small congregations in London, but nonetheless was a leading spokesman for the Confessing Church, the center of Protestant resistance to the Nazis. In 1935, Bonhoeffer was appointed to organize and head a new seminary for the Confessing Church at Finkenwald. He described the community in his classic work Life Together. He later wrote The Cost of Discipleship, which quickly became a modern classic.  ",
        "Bonhoeffer was acutely aware of the difficulties of life in community, and the easy disillusionment that could come when the experience did not live up to the imagined idea.  Yet he also wrote eloquently of the gift and privilege of Christian community.  “It is not simply to be taken for granted that the Christian has the privilege of living among other Christians. Jesus Christ lived in the midst of his enemies. At the end all of his disciples deserted him. On the Cross he was utterly alone, surrounded by evildoers and mockers. For this cause he had come, to bring peace to the enemies of God. So the Christian, too, belongs not in the seclusion of a cloistered life but in the thick of foes.  There is his commission, his work…So between the death of Christ and the Last Day it is only by a gracious anticipation of the last things that Christians are privileged to live in visible fellowship with other Christians.”",
        "Bonhoeffer became increasingly involved in the political struggleafter 1939, when he was introduced to a group seeking Hitler’s overthrow. Bonhoeffer considered refuge in the United States, but he returned to Germany where he was able to continue his resistance.  Bonhoeffer was arrested April 5th, 1943, and imprisoned in Berlin. After an attempt on Hitler’s life failed on July 20th, 1944, documents were discovered linking Bonhoeffer to the conspiracy. He was taken to Buchenwald concentration camp, then to Schoenberg Prison. On Sunday, April 8th, 1945, just as he concluded a service in a school building in Schoenberg, two men came in with the chilling summons, “Prisoner Bonhoeffer…come with us.” He said to another prisoner, “This is the end. For me, the beginning of life.” Bonhoeffer was hanged the next day, April 9th, at Flossenburg Prison. ",
        "There is in Bonhoeffer’s life a remarkable unity of faith, prayer, writing, and action. The pacifist theologian came to accept the guilt of plotting the death of Hitler, because he was convinced that not to do so would be a greater evil. Discipleship was to be had only at great cost. "

Ordained in 1196, he soon became a canon and then sub-prior of the Cathedral of Osma, where a rule of strict discipline was established among the canons. ",

In 1214, his plan to found a special preaching order for the conversion of the Cathars began to take shape, and in the following year, he took his followers to Toulouse.  At the Fourth Lateran Council in October of 1215, Dominic sought confirmation of his order from Pope Innocent III. This was granted by Innocent’s successor, Honorius III, in 1216 and 1217. ",

The continuing Dominican apostolate embraces intellectual work and the arts of preaching, their major houses usually situated in university centers. Their Constitutions expressthe priority in this way: “In the cells, moreover, they can write, read, pray, sleep, and even stay awake at night, if they desire, on account of study.” "

What is true is that ministers of the Christian religion often assert that it is, present it for consideration as though it were, and, in fact, by their faulty exposition of it make it so. The central dogma of the Incarnation is that by which relevance stands or falls. If Christ were only man, then he is entirely irrelevant to any thought about God; if he is only God, then he is entirely irrelevant to any experience of human life. It is, in the strictest sense, necessary to the salvation of relevance that a man should believe rightly the Incarnation of Our Lord, Jesus Christ. Unless he believes rightly, there is not the faintest reason why he should believe at all. And in that case, it is wholly irrelevant to chatter about Christian principles.”",

It was not until the following century, however, that there was a revival of monasticism and spirituality. In that, the leading figure was Dunstan. ",
        "Dunstan was born about 909 into a family with royal connections. He became a monk and, in 943, was made Abbot of Glastonbury. During a year-long political exile in Flanders, he encountered the vigorous currents of the Benedictine monastic revival. King Edgar recalled Dunstan to England in 957, appointed him Bishop of Worcester, then of London; and, in 960, named him Archbishop of Canterbury. Together with his former pupils, Bishops Aethelwold of Winchester and Oswald of Worcester (later of York), Dunstan was a leader of the English church. All three have been described as “contemplatives in action”—bringing the fruits of their monastic prayer life to the immediate concerns of church and state. They sought better education and discipline among the clergy, the end of landed family interest in the church, the restoration of former monasteries and the establishment of new ones, a revival of monastic life for women, and a more elaborate and carefully ordered liturgical worship. ",
        "This reform movement was set forth in the “Monastic Agreement,” a common code for English monasteries drawn up by Aethelwold about 970, primarily under the inspiration of Dunstan. It called for continual intercession for the royal house, and emphasized the close tie between the monasteries and the crown. ",
        "The long-term effects of this tenth-century reform resulted in the retention of two peculiarly English institutions: the “monastic cathedral,” and the Celtic pattern of “monk-bishops.” ",
        "Dunstan is also reputed to have been an expert craftsman. His name is especially associated with the working of metals and the casting of bells, and he was regarded as the patron saint of those crafts.  He died at Canterbury in 988. "

In 1907, Edith assumed a position as matron at the newly founded L'École Belge d'Infirmières Diplômées (known in English as the The Berkendael Medical Institute) in Brussels. While serving as matron at the Berkendael Medical Institute, Edith launched a nursing journal, L’infirmière, and taught nursing in many schools throughout Belgium. ",

Following the German occupation of Brussels in 1914, Cavell began collaborating with others to shelter and smuggle Allied soldiers out of Belgium and into the Netherlands. Motivated by deeply held Christian faith, Edith insisted on treating wounded soldiers on both sides of the war effort, which, combined with her outspokenness against the war and the occupation, placed her in violation of German military law. Edith Cavell was arrested on August 3rd, 1915.

Instead, she spent several years teaching at a Catholic school and doing intensive study of Catholic philosophy and theology, particularly that of Thomas Aquinas.  In 1933 she was forced to leave her teaching position as a result of the anti-Semitic policies of the German Nazi government, and thus she entered a Carmelite community in Cologne where she took the name Teresa Benedicta of the Cross.

In July of 1942, the Dutch Bishops Conference issued a statement condemning Nazi racism as incompatible with Christianity, which was read in every parish church.

For weeks not only Jews but also thousands of faithful Catholics in Germany, and, I believe, all over the world, have been waiting and hoping for the Church of Christ to raise its voice to put a stop to this abuse of Christ's name. Is not this idolization of race and governmental power which is being pounded into the public consciousness by the radio open heresy? Isn't the effort to destroy Jewish blood an abuse of the holiest humanity of our Savior, of the most blessed Virgin and the apostles? Is not all this diametrically opposed to the conduct of our Lord and Savior, who, even on the cross, still prayed for his persecutors?

Atthe end of 1833, he joined John Keble and John Henry Newman in producing the Tracts for the Times, which gave the Oxford Movement its popular name of Tractarianism. ",
        "His most influential activity, however, was his preaching—catholicin content, evangelical in his zeal for souls. But to many of hismore influential contemporaries, it seemed dangerously innovative.A sermon preached before the University in 1843 on “The Holy Eucharist, a Comfort to the Penitent” was condemned without his being given an opportunity to defend it, and he himself was suspended from preaching for two years—a judgment he bore patiently.

While she died too young for her dream to be realized, Pusey dedicated himself to reviving the religious life for women so that other women would be able to respond to that sense of call even though his own daughter could not.  In 1845, he established the first Anglican sisterhood since the Reformation. It was at this community’s convent, Ascot Priory in Berkshire, that Pusey died on September 16th, 1882.

        "Elizabeth Ann Seton was the founder of the Sisters of Charity, the first community of sisters established in the United States. ",
        "Elizabeth was born in New York City on August 28th, 1774, and was raised as an Episcopalian. She endured a turbulent childhood and suffered severe bouts of depression, but persevered by immersing herself in poetry, piano lessons, and devoted participation in the Episcopal Church. From a young age, she desired to help the sick and poor. In 1795 she married William Seton, and their family came to include five children. During this time, she also founded the Society for the Relief of Poor Widows with Small Children. ",
        "In 1801, however, the family business went bankrupt. In 1803, her husband developed symptoms of tuberculosis, and they set sail for Italy in the hopes that the warm climate might cure his disease. The Italian authorities, fearing yellow fever, quarantined them in a cold stone hospital for the dying. William soon died and left Elizabeth a young widow with five children and few resources. While struggling with these losses, she was befriended by Roman Catholics and, as a result, was drawn to the Catholic Church. ",
        "Returning to New York, she encountered bitter opposition from her Episcopalian family for her new religious leanings. With five children to support, she found herself alone and in financial straits. She turned to Catholic clergy for support and, in 1805, she formally became a member of the Catholic Church. ",
        "In 1806, she met Father Louis Dubourg, who wanted to starta congregation of women religious, patterned after the French Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul. In 1809 Elizabeth took vows and became “Mother Seton” to a small community of seven women, known as the Sisters of Charity of Saint Joseph, who were dedicated to teaching. The sisters were given land in rural Maryland and, in 1810, they opened Saint Joseph’s Free School to educate needy girls. The sisters intertwined social ministry, education, and religious formation in all of their varied works. Out of the pioneering work of Elizabeth Seton, five independent communities of the Sisters of Charity now exist, offering ministry and care for the most vulnerable. ",
        "Elizabeth Ann Seton remained the superior of the Sisters of Charity until her death on January 4th, 1821. ",
        "The legacy of the Sisters of Charity has left a lasting impact on the Episcopal Church as well as on the Catholic Church.  The earliest Anglican religious orders for women used the rule of the Sisters of Charity as the basis for their own rules, and there have been Sisters of Charity in the Anglican Communion since 1869.

        "Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1815–1902)",
        "Born on November 12, 1815, into an affluent, strict Calvinist family in Johnstown, New York, Elizabeth, as a young woman, took seriously the Presbyterian doctrines of predestination and human depravity. She became very depressed, but resolved her mental crises through action. She dedicated her life to righting the wrongs perpetrated upon women by the church and society. ",
        "She and four other women organized the first Women’s Rights Convention at Seneca Falls, New York, July 19-20, 1848. The event set her political and religious agenda for the next 50 years. She held the Church accountable for oppressing women by using Scripture to enforce the subordination of women in marriage and to prohibit them from ordained ministry. She held society accountable for denying women equal access to professional jobs, property ownership, the vote, and for granting less pay for the same work. ",
        "In 1881, the Revised Version of the Bible was published by a committee which included no women scholars. Elizabeth founded her own committee of women to write a commentary on Scripture, and applying the Greek she had learned as a child from her minister, focused on passages used to oppress and discriminate against women. ",
        "Although Elizabeth blamed male clergy for women’s oppression,she attended Trinity Episcopal Church in Seneca Falls with her friend Amelia Bloomer. As a dissenting prophet, Elizabeth preached hundreds of homilies and political speeches in pulpits throughout the nation. Wherever she visited, she was experienced as a holy presence and a liberator. She never lost her sense of humor, despite years of contending with opposition, even from friends. In a note to Susan B. Anthony, she said: “Do not feel depressed, my dear friend; what is good in us is immortal, and if the sore trials we have endured are sifting out pride and selfishness, we shall not have suffered in vain.” Shortly before she died in New York City, on October 26th, 1902, she said: “My only regret is that I have not been braver and bolder and truer in the honest conviction of my soul.” ",
        "Amelia Jenks Bloomer (1818–1894)",
        "Amelia Jenks, the youngest of six children, was born in New York onMay 27th, 1818, to a pious Presbyterian family.  Early on she demonstrated a kindness of heart and a strict regard for truth and right. As a young woman, she joined in the temperance, anti-slavery, and women’s rights movements. ",
        "Amelia Jenks Bloomer never intended to make dress reform a major platform in women’s struggle for justice. But, women’s fashion ofthe day prescribed waist-cinching corsets, even for pregnant women, resulting in severe health problems. Faith and fashion collided explosively when she published in her newspaper, The Lily, a picture of herself in loose-fitting Turkish trousers, and began wearing them publicly. Clergy, from their pulpits, attacked women who wore them, citing Moses: “Women should not dress like men.” Amelia fired back: “It matters not what Moses had to say to the men and women of his time about what they should wear. If clergy really cared about what Moses said about clothes, they would all put fringes and blue ribbons on their garments.” Her popularity soared as she engaged clergy in public debate. ",
        "She insisted that “certain passages in the Scriptures relating to women had been given a strained and unnatural meaning.” And, of St. Paul she said: “Could he have looked into the future and foreseen all the sorrow and strife, the cruel exactions and oppression on the one hand and the blind submission and cringing fear on the other, that his words have sanctioned and caused, he would never have uttered them.” ",
        "And of women’s right to freedom, she wrote: “the same Power that brought the slave out of bondage will, in His own good time and way, bring about the emancipation of woman, and make her the equal in power and dominion that she was in the beginning.” ",
        "Later in life, in Council Bluffs, Iowa, a frontier town, she workedto establish churches, libraries, and school houses. She provided hospitality for traveling clergy of all denominations, and for temperance lecturers and reformers. Trinity Episcopal Church, Seneca Falls, New York, where she was baptized, records her as a “faithful Christian missionary all her life.” Amelia Jenks Bloomer died in Council Bluffs on December 30th, 1894. ",
        "Sojourner Truth (c.1797-1883)",
        "Sojourner Truth, born Isabella Baumfree to James and Elizabeth Baumfree near the turn of the 19th century, spent the first twenty-eight years of her life as a slave in the state of New York. During that time, she was separated first from her siblings and then from her children as they were sold to various slaveholders. In 1826, when her owner refused to honor his promise to emancipate her ahead of New York’s abolition of slavery, Sojourner took her infant daughter and, in her words, “walked off, believing that to be all right.” She later learned that her young son Peter had been illegally sold by her former master, and was enslaved in Alabama. She filed suit, and in 1828, two years after her escape, she won her case, becoming one of the first black women to ever prevail in an American court over a white man.",
        "With slavery abolished in the state, Sojourner moved to New York City as a free woman. Having undergone a religious conversion after her escape, she became involved in the African Methodist Episcopal Church, founded when white members of St. George’s Episcopal Church in Philadelphia would not permit African-Americans to worship alongside them as equals. Heartened by the knowledge that a black woman, Jarena Lee, had been ordained as a minister in the AME tradition, Truth was known to preach and pray and sing with remarkable passion and eloquence. She also worked at a shelter for homeless women, convinced that showing Christ’s love required meeting the material needs of the poor and vulnerable. The next decades of her life would prove tumultuous for Sojourner. She was abused by men in positions of religious authority, and in 1835 was falsely accused of crimes she did not commit. She was acquitted of all charges, and later successfully sued her accusers for slander.",
        "At approximately forty-six years old, Sojourner heard a call from God, telling her to go east and preach the gospel, telling the truth of her experiences as a slave and proclaiming the Christian imperative to support the abolition of slavery. It was at this time that she abandoned the names given to her by her master at birth, taking up for herself the name Sojourner Truth. After over a year of itinerant preaching, she joined an abolitionist co-operative in Northampton, Massachusetts, which had been founded on principles of women’s rights and pacifism in addition to its abolitionist mission.  Sojourner became a traveling preacher, approaching white religious meetings and campgrounds and asking to speak. Captivated by her charismatic presence, her wit, and her wisdom, they found her hard to refuse. She never learned to read or write, but quoted extensive Bible passages from memory in her sermons. Her reputation grew and she became part of the abolitionist and women’s rights speakers’ network.",
        "During a women’s rights convention in Ohio, Sojourner gave the speech for which she is best remembered, now known as “Ain’t I a Woman.” She had listened for hours to clergy attack women’s rights and abolition, using the Bible to support their oppressive logic: God had created women to be weak and blacks to be a subservient race. Speaking extemporaneously, she exposed the hypocrisy of the white male ministers, pointing out the ways in which slavery had forced her to become as strong as any man, and noting that Jesus himself never turned women away or refused to teach them on account of their gender. Until her death, she continued to speak and preach, advocating for the right to vote to be expanded to all women, not only white women. Sojourner passed away at her home in Michigan on November 26th, 1883. ",
        "Harriet Ross Tubman (1820-1913)",
        "Slave births were recorded under property, not as persons with names; but we know that Harriet Ross was born sometime during 1820 on a Maryland Chesapeake Bay plantation, was the sixth of eleven children born to Ben Ross and Harriet Green. Although her parents were loving and they enjoyed a cheerful family life inside their cabin, they lived in fear of the children being sold off at any time. ",
        "Harriet suffered beatings and a severe injury, but grew up strong and defiant, refusing to appear happy and smiling to her owners. To cope with brutality and oppression, she turned to religion. Her favorite Bible story was about Moses who led the Israelites out of slavery. The slaves prayed for a Moses of their own. ",
        "When she was about 24, Harriet escaped to Canada, but could not forget her parents and other slaves she left behind. Working with the Quakers, she made at least 19 trips back to Maryland between 1851 and 1861, freeing over 300 people by leading them into Canada. She was so successful that $40,000 was offered for her capture. ",
        "Guided by God through omens, dreams, warnings, she claimed her struggle against slavery had been commanded by God. She foresawthe Civil War in a vision. When it began, she quickly joined the Union Army, serving as cook and nurse, caring for both Confederate and Union soldiers. She served as a spy and scout. She led 300 black troops on a raid which freed over 750 slaves, making her the first American woman to lead troops into military action. ",
        "In 1858 – 9, she moved to upstate New York where she openedher home to African American orphans and to helpless old people. Although she was illiterate, she founded schools for African American children. She joined the fight for women’s rights, working with Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, but supported African American women in their efforts to found their own organizations to address equality, work, and education. She died on March 10th, 1913, in Auburn, New York. "

        "At an early age she showed concern for the poor and the sick, and was thus attracted to the Franciscans who came to the Wartburg in 1223. From them she received spiritual direction. Her husband was sympathetic to her almsgiving and allowed her to use her dowry for this purpose. During a famine and epidemic in 1226, when her husband was in Italy, she sold her jewels and established a hospital, where she cared for the sick and the poor. To supply their needs, she opened the royal granaries. After her husband’s death in 1227, however, the opposition of the court to such “extravagances” compelled her to leave the Wartburg with her children. ",
        "For some time, Elizabeth lived in great distress. She then took the habit of the Franciscans—the first of the Franciscan Tertiaries, or Third Order, in Germany. Finally, arrangements with her family gave her a subsistence, and she spent her remaining years in Marburg, living in self-denial and caring for the sick and needy. She died from exhaustion, November 17th, 1231, and was canonized by Pope Gregory IX four years later. With Louis of France she shares the title of patron of the Third Order of St. Francis. "

Howard was homebound and because of her confinement sought Morgan’s support for both spiritual companionship and as a means by which she could offer intercessory prayer for others. In response to her friend’s need, Morgan called together a small group of women for prayer and companionship. From that beginning, the Society of the Companions of the Holy Cross came into being.",

At one point Enmegahbowh attempted to abandon missionary work and return to Canada, but the boat was turned back by storms on Lake Superior, providing him a vision: “Here Mr. Jonah came before me and said, ‘Ah, my friend Enmegahbowh, I know you.

The Syrians called him “The Harp of the Holy Spirit,” and his hymns still enrich the liturgies of the Syriac churches. Ephrem was one whose writings were influential in the development of Christian doctrine. Jerome writes: “I have read in Greek a volume of his on the Holy Spirit, and though it was only a translation, I recognized therein the sublime genius of the man.” ",
        "Ephrem was born at Nisibis in Mesopotamia. At eighteen, he was baptized by James, Bishop of Nisibis. It is believed that Ephrem accompanied James to the famous Council of Nicaea in 325 and served as his secretary, deacon, and theological assistant. He lived at Nisibis until 363, when the Persians captured the city and drove out the Christians. ",
        "Ephrem retired to a cave in the hills above the city of Edessa. There he wrote most of his spiritual works. Discovering that hymns could be of great value in support of the Christian faith, he opposed Gnostic hymns with his own, sung by choirs of women. An example is “From God Christ’s deity came forth” (The Hymnal 1982, #443). This establishment of female choirs gave an important liturgical role to women within the early Syriac church, and the strong theological content of the hymns meant that women were also being educated in theology.  Catechizing women was considered to be the most effective way of teaching the faith because of the influence that they would likely have on their children.  Therefore, women’s education was a high priority.",
        "Ephrem’s homilies and poems often employ vivid and memorable imagery.  In describing the death and resurrection of Christ in his Homily on Our Lord, he wrote: “When Death came confidently as usual, to feed on mortal fruit, Life, the killer of Death, was lying in wait...Because of one thing which it could not eat, Death had to give back everything inside that it had eaten, for when a person's stomach is upset, he vomits out what had agreed with him as well as what disagrees with him. Thus Death's stomach became upset, and when it vomited out the Medicine of Life which had soured it, it vomited out with Him all those whom it had been pleased to swallow.”",

In his commentary on the Passion, he wrote: “No one has seen or shall see the things which you have seen. The Lord himself has become the altar, priest, and bread, and the chalice of salvation. He alone suffices for all, yet none suffices for him. He is Altar and Lamb, victim and sacrifice, priest as well as food.” "

She spent nearly fifteen years wrestling painfully with the idea of converting to Roman Catholicism, but in the end she discerned that she was called to remain as an Anglican.",
        "In 1921, Evelyn Underhill became reconciled to her Anglican roots, while remaining what she called a “Catholic Christian.” She continued with her life of reading, writing, meditation, and prayer. She had already published her first great spiritual work, Mysticism. This was followed by many other books, culminating in her most widely read and studied book, Worship (1937). ",
        "Evelyn Underhill’s most valuable contribution to spiritual literature must surely be her conviction that the mystical life is not only open to a saintly few, but to anyone who cares to nurture it and weave it into everyday experience, and also (at the time, a startling idea) that modern psychological theories and discoveries, far from hindering or negating spirituality, can actually enhance and transform it. In Mysticism, she writes: “We are, then, one and all the kindred of the mystics; and it is by dwelling upon this kinship, by interpreting—so far as we may—their great declarations in the light of our little experience, that we shall learn to understand them best. Strange and far away though they seem, they are not cut off from us by some impassable abyss. They belong to us. They are our brethren; the giants, the heroes of our race. As the achievement of genius belongs not to itself only, but also to the society that brought it forth; as theology declares that the merits of the saints avail for all; so, because of the solidarity of the human family, the supernal accomplishment of the mystics is ours also.”",
        "Evelyn Underhill’s writings proved appealing to many, resulting in a large international circle of friends and disciples, making her much in demand as a lecturer and retreat director. She died, at age 65, on June 15th, 1941. "

Suddenly, according to the historian Eusebius, a dove flew over the crowd and lighted on Fabian’s head. In spite of the fact that he was both a total stranger and not even a candidate for election, the people unanimously chose Fabian to be pope, shouting, “He is worthy! He is worthy!” Fabian was ordained to the episcopate without opposition.",
        "During his fourteen years as pontiff, Fabian made numerous administrative reforms. He developed the parochial structure of the Church in Rome, and established the custom of venerating martyrs at their shrines in the catacombs. He also appointed seven deacons and seven sub-deacons to write the lives of the martyrs, so that their deeds would not be forgotten in times to come.",
        "In the year 250, the Emperor Decius ordered everyone within the Roman Empire to offer sacrifices to the Roman gods and for the welfare of the emperor.  The refusal of many Christians to do this resulted in a number of them being executed.  As the head of his community, Fabian was one of the earliest to be martyred, setting a courageous example for the rest of the church to emulate. ",
        "Cyprian of Carthage, in a letter to Fabian’s successor Cornelius, wrote that Fabian was an incomparable man. “The glory of his death,” Cyprian commented, “befitted the purity and holiness of his life.”",
        "Fabian was buried in the catacombs of Rome, where his grave marker still exists. It is in fragments, but the words “Fabian . . . bishop . . . martyr” remain dimly visible."

When she was baptized as a student, she chose the name of Florence in honor of Florence Nightingale. Florence studied at Union Theological College in Guangzhou (Canton). In 1938, upon graduation, she served as a lay worker, first in Kowloon and then in nearby Macao. ",
        "In May 1941 Florence was ordained as a deaconess. Some months later, Hong Kong fell to Japanese invaders, and priests could not travel to Macao to celebrate the Eucharist. Despite this setback, Florence continued her ministry. Her work came to the attention of Bishop Ronald Hall of Hong Kong, who decided that “God’s work would reap better results if she had the proper title” of priest.  On January 25th, 1944, the Feast of the Conversion of St. Paul, Bishop Hall ordained her as a priest. ",
        "When World War II came to an end, Florence Li Tim-Oi’s ordination became the subject of much controversy. She made the personal decision not to exercise her priesthood until it was acknowledged by the wider Anglican Communion. Undeterred, she continued to minister with great faithfulness, and in 1947 was appointed rector of St. Barnabas Church in Hepu where, on Bishop Hall’s instructions, she was still to be called priest.

        "When the Communists came to power in China in 1949, Florence undertook theological studies in Beijing to further understand the implications of the Three-Self Movement (self-rule, self-support, and self- propagation) which now determined the life of the churches. She then moved to Guangzhou to teach and to serve at the Cathedral of Our Savior. However, for sixteen years during the Cultural Revolution, from 1958 onwards, all churches were closed. Florence was forced to work first on a farm and then in a factory. Accused of counter-revolutionary activity, she was required to undergo political re-education. Finally, in 1974, she was allowed to retire from her work in the factory. ",
        "In 1979 the churches reopened, and Florence resumed her public ministry. Then, two years later, she was allowed to visit family members living in Canada.

        "As a young man, Francis studied for a political career, but he was deeply anxious for his salvation, prone to melancholy and despair, and was convinced that he has been predestined for damnation.  In 1587, however, while a visitor at a church in Paris, he had a profound experience of the love of God.  This sense of God’s love and mercy would mark his writings on the spiritual life from that time forward.  In response to this overwhelming sense of God’s love, Francis changed his trajectory and resolved to become a priest.",
        "In 1602 he became bishop of Geneva, although he was forced to remain in the parts of his diocese that were outside of the city, since Geneva itself was under Calvinist control.  He wrote a number of books on the spiritual life which stressed the importance of love for God and neighbor rather than focusing on sin and penance, and which were notable in being directed towards laypeople.  The influence of his Introduction to the Devout Life was not limited to Roman Catholic circles, but exerted an influence on Protestant spiritual writers as well, including many Anglicans.  In addition to his writing, Francis worked with Jane de Chantal in her foundation of a new religious order for women, the Congregation of the Visitation.",

She devoted herself instead to caring for the poor and the sick, to raising her children, and to managing her late husband’s estates.  Francis de Sales would become her spiritual director in 1604.",
        "In 1610, Francis and Jane established the Congregation of the Visitation.  Initially devoted to serving the poor and the sick, the order gradually evolved in a more contemplative direction.  During Jane’s 31 years in the community, she gave spiritual direction to a number of women and men in the form of letters, many of which have been preserved.  Unusually, her order actively welcomed women as sisters who would not be considered by other orders because of their poor health or advanced age.  When others questioned the wisdom of this decision, Jane merely replied, “What would you have me do? I rather like sick people myself. I'm on their side.”  By the time she died in 1641, the order had already grown to include 34 houses. ",

Despite his father’s intense opposition, Francis totally renounced all material values and devoted himself to serve the poor.

But, by 1221, Francis hadlost control of it, since his ideal of strict and absolute poverty, bothfor the individual friars and for the order as a whole, was found to be too difficult to maintain. His last years were spent in much suffering of body and spirit, but his unconquerable joy never failed.  In his later years he was ordained as a deacon, but he resisted all efforts to persuade him to become a priest.",

Civil strife and localized resistance made Francis’ Japanese efforts difficult, but he came away from the experience witha deep sense of respect for the people and their culture. ",

Maurice studied civil law at Cambridge, but refused the degree in 1827, because, as a Dissenter, he could not subscribe to the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion.

Maurice was dismissed from his professorships because of his leadership in the Christian Socialist Movement, and because of the alleged unorthodoxy of his Theological Essays (1853). ",
        "Maurice saw worship as the meeting point of time and eternity, and as the fountain of energies for the church’s mission. He wrote, “I do not think we are to praise the liturgy but to use it. When we do not want it for our life, we may begin to talk of it as a beautiful composition.” ",
        "After the death of the Christian Socialist Movement in 1854, Maurice founded the Working Men’s College, and resumed teaching at Queen’s College, London. Maurice awakened Anglicanism to the need for concern with the problems of society. In later years, he was honored even by former opponents.

At the age of 14, he had experienced a conversion to Christ in the African Methodist Episcopal Church, and his recollection of that tradition’s spiritual music sustained him in his struggle for freedom: “Those songs still follow me, to deepen my hatred of slavery, and quicken my sympathies for my brethren in bonds.” ",

In 1845, he went to England on a speaking tour. His friends in America raised enough money to buy out his master’s legal claim to him, so that he could return to the United States in safety.

Through his official position as Public Orator of Cambridge, he was brought into contact with the Court of King James I and Prince (later King) Charles. Whatever hopes he may have had as a courtier were dimmed, however, because of his associations with persons who were out of favor with King Charles I—principally John Williams, Bishop of Lincoln. Herbert had begun studying divinity in his early twenties, and, in 1626, he was ordained as a priest. In 1630, King Charles provided him with a living as rector of the parishes of Fugglestone and Bemerton.   His collection of poems, The Temple, was given to his friend, Nicholas Ferrar, and published posthumously. Two of his poems are well known hymns: “Teach me, my God and King,” (The Hymnal 1982, #592) and “Let all the world in every corner sing” (The Hymnal 1982, #402; #403).

        "Gregory of Nazianzus, one of the Cappadocian Fathers, loved God, the art of letters, and the human race—in that order. He was born about 330 in Nazianzus in Cappadocia (now Turkey), the son of a local bishop. He studied rhetoric in Athens with his friend Basil of Caesarea, and Julian, later to be the apostate emperor. ",
        "In 361, against his will, Gregory was ordained as a priest, which he described as an “act of tyranny”.  At first he fled with Basil to Pontus where he lived a monastic life of seclusion, but eventually he returned home to assume to work of a priest.  His Oration 2, “In Defense of his Flight to Pontus”, remains one of the classic treatments of the weight and responsibilities of the pastoral office.  He writes: “I was ashamed of all of those men who intrude into these most sacred offices when they are no better than ordinary people.  Indeed, it is really very lucky if they are not a good deal worse, with unwashed hands and uninstructed souls, laying claim to the sanctuary before being worthy even to approach the temple, and pushing and shoving their way up to the holy altar as if they thought that the priesthood was simply a way of earning a living rather than a pattern of virtue, or as though it were an absolute authority instead of a ministry for which we will have to render an account.  Indeed, such priests are almost more numerous than those whom they are supposed to govern, pathetic with respect to piety and completely lacking in dignity, so that it seems to me that as time and evil progress, they will eventually have no one left to rule because everyone will be a teacher.”",
        "In time, however, Gregory reconciled himself to his calling and felt prepared to undertake it, and settled down to live an austere, priestly life. He was not to have peace for long. Basil, in his fight against the Arian Emperor Valens, compelled Gregory to become Bishop of Sasima. According to Gregory, it was “a detestable little place without water or grass or any mark of civilization.” He felt, he said, like “a bone flung to the dogs.” His friendship with Basil suffered a severe break. Deaths in his family, and then that of his estranged friend Basil, brought Gregory himself to the point of death, and he withdrew into seclusion again for healing. ",
        "In 379, Gregory moved to Constantinople, a new man and no longer in despair. He appeared as one a fire with the love of God. His fame as a theologian rests on five sermons he delivered during this period on the doctrine of the Trinity. They are marked by clarity, strength, and cheerfulness, and remain to this day one of the most influential expositions of Trinitarian theology.  The next year, the new Emperor Theodosius entered Constantinople and expelled its Arian bishop and clergy. Then, on a rainy day, the crowds in the Great Church of Hagia Sophia acclaimed Gregory bishop, after a ray of sunlight suddenly shone on him. ",
        "Gregory was asked to preside over the ecumenical council in Constantinople in 381.  However, exhausted by the politicking and infighting that beset the task, he shocked the assembled bishops by abruptly tendering his resignation.  He retired to his home town of Nazianzus, where he continued to write and minister to the people until his death in 390. "

        "Gregory was a man enchanted with Christ and dazzled by the meaning of his Passion. He was born in Caesarea in Cappadocia around 334, the younger brother of Basil the Great and, in his youth, was a reluctant Christian. ",
        "When he was twenty, the transfer of the relics of the Forty Martyrsof Sebaste to the family chapel at Annesi quickened Gregory’s faith, and he became a practicing Christian and a lector. He later abandoned this ministry, however, to become a rhetorician like his father. ",
        "His brother Basil, in his struggle against the Emperor Valens, compelled Gregory to become Bishop of Nyssa, a town ten miles from Caesarea. Knowing himself to be unfit for the charge, Gregory described his ordination as the most miserable day of his life. He lacked the important episcopal skills of tact and understanding, and had no sense of the value of money. Falsely accused of embezzling church funds, Gregory went into hiding for two years, not returning to his diocese until Valens died. ",
        "Although he resented his brother’s dominance, Gregory was shocked by Basil’s death in 379. Several months later, he received another shock: his beloved sister Macrina was dying. Gregory hastened to Annesi and conversed with her for two days about death, the soul, and the meaning of the resurrection.  Macrina died in her brother’s arms. ",
        "The two deaths, while stunning Gregory, also freed him to develop as a deeper and richer philosopher and theologian. He reveals his delight in the created order in his treatise, On the Making of Man. He exposes the depth of his contemplative and mystical nature in his Life of Moses and again in his Commentary on the Song of Songs. His Great Catechism is considered second only to Origen’s treatise On First Principles and his treatise On Virginity is a masterpiece of ascetical theology.",
        "Gregory’s theological writings have received a resurgence of interest among Christian theologians starting in the mid-20th century, and he is regarded as one of the “Cappadocian Fathers” together with his brother Basil and their friend Gregory of Nazianzus. Gregory died on March 9th, probably in Nyssa, around the year 394. "

        "Gregory was born into a patrician family about540, and became Prefect of Rome in 573.  Shortly thereafter, however, he retired to a monastic life in a community which he founded in his ancestral home on the Coelian Hill.  Pope Pelagius II made him Ambassador to Constantinople in 579, where he learned much about the larger affairs of the church. Not long after his return home, Pope Pelagius died of the plague, and in 590, Gregory was elected as his successor. ",
        "Gregory wrote eloquently about the demands of the pastoral office and the dangers of seeking it too rashly.  He said: “Those who aspire to the priesthood usually delude themselves into thinking that they are seeking it out of a desire to perform good works, although this actually stems from pride and a desire to accomplish great things.  Thus one thing takes place in their conscious mind, but another motive is hidden secretly within.  For the mind frequently lies to itself about itself, pretending that it loves the good work when it does not, and that it does not care for worldly glory when in fact it does.  The mind often has appropriate trepidation about seeking office, but once a leadership position has been secured, it assumes that it has achieved what it rightly deserved.  When it begins to enjoy its newfound superiority, it quickly forgets all of the spiritual thoughts that it once had.  Therefore, when thoughts begin to stray, it is good to direct them back to the past, and for a person to consider how he behaved while still under authority.  In this way he will judge himself more accurately, for no one can learn humility in a position of leadership who did not learn it when he was in a position of subjection.  No one will know how to flee from praise when it abounds if he secretly yearned for praise when it was absent.  Therefore, let each person judge his own character on the basis of his past life so that the fantasy of his thoughts will not deceive him.”",
        "Gregory’s pontificate was one of strenuous activity. He organizedthe defense of Rome against the attacks of the Lombards and fed its populace from papal granaries in Sicily. In this, as in other matters, he administered “the patrimony of St. Peter” with energy and efficiency. His ordering of the church’s liturgy and chant has molded the spirituality of Western Christianity until the present day. His writings provided succeeding generations with a number of influential texts, especially his Pastoral Care, which remains to this day a classic text on the work of Christian ministry.  Gregory understood well the intricacies of the human heart, and the ease with which growth in holiness may be compromised by self-deception.  He wrote: “The pastor must understand that vices commonly masquerade as virtues.  The person who is not generous claims to be frugal, while the one who is a prodigal describes himself as generous.  Inordinate laxity pretends to be kindness, and unbridled anger passes for being spiritual zeal.  Rashness is called efficiency, and laziness pretends to be deliberation.  Thus, it is necessary that the director of souls discern between vices and virtues with great care.”",
        "In the midst of all his cares and duties, Gregory prepared and fostered the evangelizing mission to the Anglo-Saxons under Augustine and other monks from his own monastery. For this reason, the English historian Bede justly called Gregory “The Apostle of the English.” Gregory died on March 12th, 604, and was buried in Saint Peter’s Basilica. His life was a true witness to the title he assumed for his office: “Servant of the servants of God.” "

As a buffer state between the more powerful empires of Rome and Persia, Armenia endured many shifts of policy, as first one and then the other empire took it “under protection.” Armenia’s conversion was actually preceded by those of two other small buffer kingdoms between Persia and Rome: Adiabene and Osroene.  However, by the third century neither of these kingdoms existed as a self-governing entity.  ",

He married a woman named Mary, who bore him two sons. About 280, he returned to Armenia and, after experiencing various fortunes of honor and imprisonment, succeeded in converting King Tiridates to his faith. With the help of the king the country was Christianized, and paganism was rooted out. About 300, Gregory was ordained a bishop at Caesarea.

Instead, they pledged to be bound by the traditional vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience only as long as they lived in the community.  ",
        "The Beguine movement was particularly attractive to women who could not afford the (often substantial) dowry that was required by many monasteries, but the level of Hadewijch’s education suggests that she was probably from a wealthy background.  Her writings show that, in addition to her native language of Dutch, she was conversant with theological writings in both Latin and French, and also with French courtly poetry.",

Around this time, her began to address issues of religious concerns and social reform, particularly the evils of slavery.  She also wrote on a number of other religious topics, with important works such as Practical Piety (1811), Christian Morals (1813), and The Character of St. Paul (1815).

Many of More’s poems drew forceful attention to the evils of slavery and forced the issue into the public gaze.

One of the earliest orders, the Community of Saint John Baptist, grew out of a mission in Clewer, one of the neighborhoods of Windsor, which offered safe shelter and rehabilitation to women caught by poverty in a life of destitution and human trafficking.  This work caught the imagination of Harriet Monsell, whose husband, a priest of the Church of England, had recently died.  Her brother-in-law, also a priest, had settled in the area, and so the connection was made that drew her into the work that would form the basis for a new sisterhood.  On Ascension Day, 1851, Harriet made her first commitment to the religious life, and within a year, two others joined her. On St Andrew’s Day, 1852, she made her profession and was installed as superior by Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford.   ",
        "At this time, there were no permanent vows taken; the Bishop shared a common aversion to what was understood as a restrictive and debilitating structure.  The Community had a twofold focus in both the contemplative and active life.  Devotion and a full appropriation of the Daily Office was a key part of the community’s worship.  They also made one of the first efforts to produce an English language version of the Breviary.   ",
        "Deeply rooted in earnest prayer, Mother Harriet spoke clearly of the crucial call to active service: “I suppose the Sisters must always be ready to leave God for God...to leave God in devotion to seek God in those for whom [Christ] shed His Blood...to be ready to use broken prayer for themselves and for them.”",
        "Mother Harriet served as superior of the order until her health made retirement a necessity in 1875.  She continued to take an active interest in the work of her sisters and in the affairs of the larger world, however, and all of this was the focus of her prayer and intercession. One of the prayers she wrote for her community begins: “Grant unto us, O great and glorious God, that we may be faithful souls, fervent in prayer, still in God, zealous for souls, ardent seekers after holiness, full of love and tenderness…ever being drawn into the Divine Unity, into the fellowship of the Blessed Trinity, that we may reveal the mind of Christ…”   ",

To ensure it was truly the cross of Christ, a woman near death was carried to the site and touched each cross in turn. On the third one she was cured and Helena declared this to be the one. She ordered that a church be built which would be called the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. ",
        "Regardless of the truth of the legend itself, it is certain that she claimed to have found this and many other holy sites and relics on her journey, and that many of these remain prominent sites of Christian pilgrimage to this day. Unfortunately, she would not live to see the completion of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, as she died in 330, five years before its completion.",
        "Helena also had a reputation as a faithful Christian who cared for the poor. After her death several towns would be named in her honor and she would also eventually be given the title of “Equal to the Apostles” in the Orthodox Church.  Helena’s faith in her Lord was not a detached spirituality, but an embodied and historical one, such that she eagerly sought to find the very places where the Son of God had walked, taught, died, and rose again."

        "Martyn was educated at Cambridge. He had intended to become a lawyer, but Charles Simeon, the rector of Holy Trinity, Cambridge, inspired him to go to India as a missionary. After serving as Simeon’s curate for a short time, Martyn traveled to Calcutta in 1806 as chaplain of the East India Company. ",
        "During his five years in India, Martyn preached the gospel, organized private schools, and founded churches. In addition to his work as a missionary, Martyn translated the New Testament and the Book of Common Prayer into Hindi, which was a valuable missionary aid to the young Anglican Church in India. He also began the study of Persian, and translated the New Testament into that language as well. ",
        "Martyn longed to go to Persia, and in 1811, his persistence brought himto Shiraz, as the first English clergyman in that city. He engaged in theological discussions with learned Muslims and corrected his Persian translations of the New Testament. Martyn hoped eventually to visit Arabia and to translate the New Testament into Arabic. ",
        "While on his way to Constantinople in 1812, however, Martyn died in the Turkish city of Tokat. The Armenian Orthodox Christians of the city buried him with the honors usually accorded toone of their own bishops. Very soon afterwards, his life of energetic devotion and remarkable accomplishment became widely known. He is remembered as one of the founders of the modern Christian church in both India and Iran.

Naturally pious from an early age, Herman entered the Trinity-St. Sergius Hermitage near St. Petersburg at the age of 16 and, drawn to the spiritual charism of Abbot Nasarios, eventually transferred to the Valaam Monastery.  He was never ordained, although his Metropolitan suggested it several times.  For many years he secured permission to live as a hermit, attending the liturgies of the monastery only on holy days. ",

        "Herman advocated for and defended the native Aleut against sometimes-oppressive authorities, particular Russian and European colonists with commercial interests.  He cared lovingly and sacrificially for all who came to him, counseling and teaching them, and tirelessly nursing the sick.  He especially loved children, for whom he often baked biscuits and cookies. ",
        "Even though Herman had minimal formal education outside of the monastic life, he was regarded among the native Alaskans as a great and compelling teacher.  Over time he also developed a reputation as a teacher and sage among the Russian and European settlers in the area.  He so captivated his listeners that many would listen to him through the long hours of the night and not leave his company until morning.  The people he served often referred to Herman as their North Star. ",

        "Hilary, Bishop of Poitiers, was a prolific writer on scripture and doctrine, an orator, and a poet to whom some of the earliest Latin hymns have been attributed. Augustine called him “the illustrious doctor of the churches.” Jerome considered him “the trumpet of the Latins against the Arians.”",
        "Hilary was born in Poitiers, in Gaul, about 315, into a pagan family of wealth and power. In his writings, he describes the stages of the spiritual journey that led him to the Christian faith. He was baptized when he was about thirty. ",
        "In 350, Hilary was made Bishop of Poitiers. Although he demurred, he was finally persuaded by popular acclamation. He proved to be a bishop of skill and courage. His orthodoxy was shown when, in 355, the Emperor Constantius ordered all bishops to sign a condemnation of Athanasius, under pain of exile. Hilary wrote to Constantius, pleading for peace and unity. His plea accomplished nothing, and, when he dissociated himself from three Arian bishops in the West, Constantius ordered Julian (later surnamed the Apostate) to exile him to Phrygia. There he remained for three years without complaining, writing biblical commentaries and his principal work, On the Trinity. ",
        "Hilary was then invited by a party of “semi-Arians,” who hopedfor his support, to a Council at Seleucia in Asia, largely attendedby Arians.  With remarkable courage, in the midst of a hostile gathering, Hilary defended the Council of Nicaea and the Nicene doctrine of the Trinity.  He wrote again to Constantius, offering to debate Saturninus, the Western bishop largely responsible for his exile. The Arians feared the results of such an encounter and persuaded Constantius to simply return Hilary to Poitiers. ",
        "In 360, Hilary was welcomed back to his see with great demonstrations of joy and affection. He continued his battle against Arianism, but he never neglected the needs of his people. While fierce in controversy with heretical bishops, he was always a loving and compassionate pastor to the people of his diocese. He died in Poitiers in 367. Among his disciples was Martin, later Bishop of Tours, whom Hilary encouraged in his endeavors to promote the monastic life. ",
        "The hymn “Hail this day’s joyful return” (The Hymnal 1982, #223; #224) is attributed to Hilary. "

        "Hilda, born in 614, was the grandniece of King Edwin. She was instructed by Paulinus (one of the companions of Augustine of Canterbury) in the doctrines of Christianity in preparation for her baptism at the age of thirteen. She lived at the King’s court for twenty years and then decided to enter the monastic life. She had hoped to join the convent of Chelles in Gaul, but Bishop Aidan was so impressed by her holiness of life that he recalled her to her home country, in East Anglia, to live in a small monastic settlement. ",
        "One year after her return, she was appointed Abbess of Hartlepool. There, Hilda established the rule of life that she had been taught by Paulinus and Aidan. She became renowned for her wisdom, her eagerness for learning, and her devotion to God’s service. ",
        "Some years later, she founded the abbey at Whitby, where both nuns and monks lived in strict obedience to Hilda’s rule of justice, devotion, chastity, peace, and charity. Known for her prudence and good sense, Hilda was sought out by kings and other public figures for advice and counsel. Several of her monks became bishops, and atleast one pursued further studies in Rome. She encouraged the poet Caedmon, a servant at Whitby, to become a monk and to continue his inspired writing. All who knew her, Bede remarks, called her “mother.” ",
        "In 663, Whitby was the site of the famous synod convened to decide divisive questions involved in the differing traditions of Celtic Christians and the followers of Roman order. Hilda favored the Celtic position, but, when the Roman position prevailed, she was obedient to the synod’s decision. Hilda died on November 17th, 680, surrounded by her nuns and monks, whom, in her last hour, she urged to preserve the gospel of peace. "

        "Drawn by their life of silence and prayer, other women joined them, finding the freedom, rare outside of women’s religious communities, to develop their intellectual gifts. They organized as a convent under the authority of the abbot of Disibodenberg, with Jutta as abbess. When Jutta died, Hildegard, then 38, became abbess. Later she founded independent convents at Bingen (1150) and Eibingen (1165), with the Archbishop of Mainz as her only superior. ",
        "From childhood, Hildegard experienced dazzling spiritual visions.When she was 43, a voice commanded her to tell what she saw. Thus began an outpouring of extraordinarily original writings, illustrated by unusual and wondrous illuminations. These works abound with feminine imagery for God and God’s creative activity. ",

Hildegard quickly became famous, and was eagerly sought for counsel, becoming a correspondent of kings and queens, abbots and abbesses, archbishops and popes. ",

She also practiced medicine, focusing on women’s needs; published treatises on natural science and philosophy; and wrote a liturgical drama, The Play of the Virtues, in which the personified virtues sing their parts and the devil, condemned to live without music, can only speak. For Hildegard, music was essential to worship. Her liturgical compositions, unusual in structure and tonality, were described by her contemporaries as “chant of surpassing sweet melody” and “strange and unheard-of music.” ",
        "Hildegard lived in a world accustomed to male governance. Yet within her convents, and to a surprising extent outside of them, she exercised a commanding spiritual authority based on confidence in her visions and considerable political astuteness. When she died in 1179 at the age of 81, she left a rich legacy which speaks eloquently across the ages. "

        "Hugh Latimer, Nicholas Ridley, and Thomas Cranmer were among the early Anglican bishops who were executed during the reign of the Roman Catholic Queen Mary I. Hugh Latimer was born around 1490 and graduated from Clare College, Cambridge. King Henry VIII made him a royal chaplain in 1530, and five years later appointed him to the See of Worcester, a position he relinquished in 1539 in opposition to the king’s reactionary policies against the progress of the Reformation.  During the reign of Edward VI, Latimer became prominent as a preacher, but he refused to resume his see. With the accession of Queen Mary in 1553 he was imprisoned, and, on October 16th, 1555, he was burned at the stake in Oxford alongside Bishop Nicholas Ridley. ",
        "Nicholas Ridley was born in Northumberland and was educated at Pembroke College, Cambridge. A supporter of Archbishop Cranmer’s reforming agenda, he was made Bishop of Rochester and participated with Cranmer in the preparation of the first Bookof Common Prayer. He was translated to the See of London in 1550, where he was a strong advocate for and administrator of the principles of the Reformation. His unwillingness to recant of his Protestant theology and his opposition to the accession of Queen Mary led to his condemnation and his execution in 1555.",
        "According to a famous, but possibly apocryphal account, Latimer said to Ridley before their execution: “Play the man, Master Ridley; we shall this day light such a candle, by God’s grace, in England, as I trust shall never be put out.”",
        "Thomas Cranmer was born in Nottinghamshire, England, on July 2nd, 1489 and studied theology at Cambridge University, where he subsequently taught.  During his years at Cambridge, he diligently studied the Bible and the new doctrines emanating from the continental Reformation. A chance meeting with King Henry VIII in 1529 led to his involvement in the “King’s Affair” – the annulment of Henry’s marriage to Catherine of Aragon. Cranmer prepared the King’s defense and presented it to the universities in England and Germany, and to Rome.   While in Germany, Cranmer associated with the Lutheran reformers, especially with Andreas Osiander, whose daughter he married. When Archbishop Warham died, the King obtained papal confirmationof Cranmer’s appointment to the See of Canterbury, and he was consecrated on March 30th, 1533. Among his earliest acts was to declare the King’s marriage null and void. He then validated the King’s marriage to Anne Boleyn. Her child, the future Queen Elizabeth I, was Cranmer’s godchild. ",
        "During the reign of Edward VI, Cranmer had a free hand in reforming the worship, doctrine, and practice of the Church. He was principally responsible for the first Book of Common Prayer of 1549, and for the second Book, in 1552. But at Edward’s death he subscribed to the dying King’s will that the succession should pass to his cousin, Lady Jane Grey. For this, and also for his reforming work, he was arrested, deprived of his office and authority, and condemned by Queen Mary I, a staunch Roman Catholic. He was burned at the stake on March 21st, 1556. ",
        "Cranmer wrote two recantations during his imprisonment, butultimately denied his recantations and died heroically, saying, “Forasmuch as my hand offended in writing contrary to my heart, there my hand shall first be punished; for if I may come to the fire, it shall first be burned.”"

        "Seven letters, which Ignatius wrote to churches while he journeyed across Asia Minor in the custody of ten soldiers (“my leopards,” he called them), give valuable insights into the life of the early church and the controversies that it faced. Of certain Gnostic teachings that exalted the divinity of Jesus at the expense of his humanity, Ignatius wrote: “Be deaf… to any talk that ignores Jesus Christ, of David’s lineage, of Mary; who was really born, ate, and drank; was really persecuted under Pontius Pilate; was really crucified and died in the sight of heaven and earth and the underworld. He was really raised from the dead.” ",

He wrote: “When I heard some people saying, ‘If I don’t find it in the ancient documents, I don’t believe it in the Gospel,’ I answered them, ‘But it is written there.’ They retorted, ‘That has got to be proved.’ But to my mind it is Jesus Christ who is the ancient documents.” ",
        "Ignatius maintained that the church’s unity would always spring from that liturgy by which all are initiated into Christ through baptism. He exhorted: “Try to gather more frequently to celebrate God’s Eucharist and to praise him… At these meetings you should heed the bishop and presbyters attentively and break one loaf, which is the medicine of immortality.” ",
        "Ignatius regarded the church as God’s holy order in the world. He was, therefore, concerned for the proper ordering of the church’s teaching and worship. He wrote: “Flee from schism as the source of mischief. You should all follow the bishop as Jesus Christ did the Father. Follow, too, the priests as you would the apostles; and respect the deacons as you would God’s law… Where the bishop is present, there let the congregation gather, just as where Jesus Christ is, there is the catholic church.” "

During his convalescence at Loyola, Ignatius experienced a profound spiritual awakening. Following his recovery and an arduous period of retreat, a call to be Christ’s knight in the service of God’s kingdom was deepened and confirmed. ",
        "Ignatius began to share the fruits of his experience with others, making use of a notebook which eventually became the text of the Spiritual Exercises. Since his time, many have found the Exercises to be a way of encountering Christ as intimate companion and responding to Christ’s call: “Whoever wishes to come with me must labor with me.” ",
        "The fact that Ignatius was an unschooled layman made him suspect in the eyes of church authorities and led him, at the age of 37, to study theology at the University of Paris in preparation for the priesthood. While there, Ignatius gave the Exercises to several of his fellow students; and in 1534, he and six companions took vows to live lives of strict poverty and to serve the needs of the poor. Thus, what later came to be known as the Society of Jesus was born. ",

For the author’s part, having no hindrance of this sort, he contented himself with having opposed the measure, and kept the day from respect to the requisition of the convention; but could never hear of its being kept, in above two or three places beside Philadelphia.” ",

        "There is considerable doubt about the year of Irenaeus’ birth; estimates vary from 97 to 160.  According to tradition, he learned the Christian faith in Ephesus at the feet of Polycarp, who in turn had known John the Evangelist. Some years before 177, probably while Irenaeus was still a teenager, he carried the tradition of Christianity to Lyons in southern France. ",
        "The year 177 brought hardship to the mission in Gaul. Persecution brokeout, and theological divisions within the fledgling Christian community threatened to engulf the church. Irenaeus, by now a priest, was sent to Rome to mediate the dispute regarding Montanism, which the Bishop of Rome, Eleutherus, seemed to embrace. While Irenaeus was on this mission, the aged Bishop of Lyons, Pothinus, died in prison during a local persecution. When Irenaeus returned to Lyons, he was elected bishop to succeed Pothinus. ",
        "Irenaeus’ enduring fame rests mainly on a large treatise, entitled The Refutation and Overthrow of Gnosis, Falsely So-Called, usually shortened to Against Heresies. In it, Irenaeus describes the major Gnostic systems, thoroughly, clearly, and often with biting humor. It is one of our chief sources of knowledge about Gnosticism. He also makes a case for orthodox Christianity which has become a classic, resting heavily on Scripture and on the continuity between the teaching of the Apostles and the teaching of bishops, generation after generation. Against the Gnostics, who despised the flesh and exalted the spirit, he stressed two doctrines: that of creation being good, and that of the resurrection of the body.  He famous wrote that “the glory of God is a human being fully alive, and full human life consists in the vision of God.”",

        "Isabel Hapgood, a lifelong and faithful Episcopalian, was a force behind ecumenical relations between the Episcopal Church and Russian Orthodoxy in the United States around the turn of the twentieth century. Born in Massachusetts on November 21st, 1851, Hapgood was a superior student with a particular talent for the study of languages. In addition to the standard fare of the time—Latin and French—she also mastered most of the Romance and Germanic languages of Europe as well as Russian, Polish, and Church Slavonic. She possessed the particular gift of being able to translate the subtleties of Russian into equally nuanced English. Her translations made the works of Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Gorky, and Chekov, among others, available to English readers. ",
        "From 1887 until 1889, Hapgood traveled extensively in Russia, cementing her lifelong love of Russia, its language and culture, and particularly the Russian Orthodox Church. She would make return visits to Russia almost every year for the rest of her life. ",
        "Her love of Russian Orthodoxy and its Divine Liturgy led her to seek the permission of the hierarchy to translate the rites into English. Hapgood’s already established reputation as a sensitive translator certainly contributed, but in the meantime she had developed close relationships with Russian clergy and musicians at all levels. The work, Service Book of the Holy Orthodox-Catholic Church, took eleven years to complete. It received support of the Russian Orthodox bishops in North America, particularly Archbishop Tikhon, who was later to give Hapgood’s work a second blessing when he became Patriarch of Moscow. ",

        "When the General Convention of 1835 declared all the members of the Episcopal Church to be members also of the Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society, it provided at the same time for missionary bishops to serve in the wilderness and in foreign countries. Jackson Kemper was the first such bishop. Although he was assigned to Missouri and Indiana, he also laid foundations in Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Kansas, and made extensive missionary tours in the South and Southwest. ",
        "Kemper was born in Pleasant Valley, New York, on December 24th, 1789. He graduated from Columbia College in 1809 and was ordained as a deacon in 1811 and as a priest in 1814. He served Bishop White as his assistant at Christ Church, Philadelphia. At his urging, Bishop White made his first and only visitation in western Pennsylvania.  In 1835, Kemper was ordained as a bishop, and immediately set out on his travels. ",
        "Because Episcopal clergy, mostly from well-to-do Eastern homes, found it hard to adjust to the harsh life of the frontier—scorching heat, drenching rains, and winter blizzards—Kemper established Kemper College in St. Louis, Missouri, the first of many similar attempts to train clergy and laity for specialized tasks in the church. The College failed in 1845 from the usual malady of such projects in the church—inadequate funding. Nashotah House, in Wisconsin, which he founded in 1842 with the help of James Lloyd Breck and his companions, was more successful. So was Racine College, founded in 1852. Both these institutions reflected Kemper’s devotion to beauty in ritual and worship. ",
        "Kemper pleaded for more attention to the Native Americans and encouraged the translation of services into native languages. He described a service among the Oneida which was marked by “courtesy, reverence, worship—and obedience to that Great Spirit in whose hands are the issues of life.” ",
        "From 1859 until his death, Kemper was diocesan Bishop of Wisconsin, but he is more justly honored by his unofficial title, “The Bishop of the Whole Northwest.” "

In addition, he administered a preparatory school and assisted at the Church of St. John Chrysostom in Delafield, Wisconsin.",
        "Nashotah House was associated, from the time of its foundation, with many of the principles of the Oxford Movement, above all in its emphasis on the sacramental life of the church and the expression of devotion to the Eucharist—including such practices as bowing to the altar, at the name of Jesus, and before receiving Communion. In 1859, De Koven became Warden of Racine College at Racine, Wisconsin. ",
        "De Koven came to national attention at the General Conventions of 1871 and 1874, when the controversy over “ritualism” was at its height. In 1871, he asserted that the use of candles on the altar, incense, and genuflections were lawful, because they symbolized “the real, spiritual presence of Christ” which the Episcopal Church upheld, along with the Orthodox and the Lutherans. To the General Convention of 1874, De Koven expressed the religious conviction that underlay his churchmanship: “You may take away from us, if you will, every external ceremony; you may take away altars, and super-altars, lights and incense and vestments…and we will submit to you. But, gentlemen…to adore Christ’s Person in his Sacrament—that is the inalienable privilege of every Christian and Catholic heart. How we do it, the way we do it, the ceremonies with which we do it, are utterly, utterly, indifferent. The thing itself is what we plead for.”",
        "Because of his advocacy of the “ritualist” cause, consents were not given to his consecration as Bishop of Wisconsin in 1874, and of Illinois in 1875.",
        "Despite calls to serve at prominent parishes in New York City, Boston, Cincinnati, and Philadelphia, he remained in his post at Racine College, where his students admired him as “a model of great learning, gracious manners, personal holiness, and extraordinary compassion.” He died there on March 19th, 1879 and is buried on the grounds."

Serious illness soon required his return to England, but he went out again to Africa in 1884, as Bishop of Eastern Equatorial Africa.",

Ignoring the advice of his local guides and porters that the venture would be politically sensitive, and failing to heed a warning from emissaries of King Mwanga to stop, he and his party were apprehended and imprisoned. After a week of cruel privations and suffering, he and the remaining members of his company were executed on October 29th, 1885, on the orders of King Mwanga.",

Breck attended Muhlenberg’s school in Flushing, New York, before entering the University of Pennsylvania. Muhlenberg inspired him, when he was sixteen years old, to dedicate himself to a missionary life. The dedication was crystallized when Breck, with three other classmates from the General Theological Seminary, founded a religious community at Nashotah, Wisconsin, which in 1844 was on the frontier.",
        "Nashotah became a center of liturgical observance, of pastoral care, and of education. Isolated families were visited, mission stations established, and, probably for the first time since the Revolution, Episcopal missionaries were the first to reach the settlers.",
        "Although Nashotah House flourished, and became one of the seminaries of the Episcopal Church, the “religious house” ideal did not. Breck moved on to St. Paul, Minnesota, where he began the work of the Episcopal Church there. At Gull Lake, he organized St. Columba’s Mission for the Chippewa. Although the mission did not survive, it laid the foundation for work among the Native Americans by their own native priests.",
        "In 1855, Breck married, and in 1858 settled in Faribault, Minnesota, where his mission was associated with one of the first cathedrals established in the Episcopal Church in the United States. He also founded Seabury Divinity School, which later merged with Western Theological Seminary, to become Seabury-Western. In 1867, Breck went on to California, inspired principally by the opportunity of founding a new theological school. His schools in Benicia, California, did not survive, but the five parishes he founded did, and the church in California was strengthened immensely through his work. He died of exhaustion, at the age of 57, in 1876."

After graduation from Harvard, he studied theology at St. Andrew’s Divinity School in Syracuse, New York, and was ordained as a deacon and as a priest by his father, the first Bishop of Central New York. In 1880 and 1881, he ministered in a working-class congregation at Calvary Mission, Syracuse. ",
        "While attending a retreat at St. Clement’s Church in Philadelphia, Huntington discerned a call to the religious life. He considered joining the Society of St. John the Evangelist, which had by that time established a province in the United States, but he perceived a need to found an indigenous American community. ",
        "Huntington and two other priests began their common life at Holy Cross Mission on New York’s Lower East Side, ministering with the Sisters of St. John Baptist among poor immigrants. The taxing daily regimen of Eucharist, prayer, and long hours of pastoral work soon forced one priest to leave for reason of health. The other discerned that this was not his vocation. Despite these setbacks, Huntington went on alone, and on November 25th, 1884, his life vow was received by Bishop Potter of New York. ",
        "As Huntington continued his work among the immigrants, with emphasis on helping young people, he became increasingly committed to the social witness of the church. His early involvements in the single-tax movement and the labor union movement were instrumental in the eventual commitment of the Episcopal Church to social ministries. The order gradually attracted vocations and, as it grew in the ensuing years, the community moved, first to Maryland, and, in 1902, to West Park, New York, where it established the monastery which is its mother house. Huntington served as Superior on several occasions, continuing his energetic round of preaching, teaching, and spiritual counsel until his death on June 28th, 1935.

But when religion puts on armor, and God is not acknowledged by his New Testament titles, religion may have in it the power of the sword, but not the power of godliness; and we may complain of this to God, and amongst them that are afflicted, but we have no remedy but what we must expect from the fellowship of Christ's sufferings and the returns of the God of peace. In the meantime, and now that religion pretends to stranger actions upon the new principles; and men are apt to prefer a prosperous error before an afflicted truth; and some will think they are religious enough, if their worshippings have in them the great earnestness and passion, with much zeal and desire; that we refuse no labor; that we bestow upon it much time; that we use the best guides, and arrive at the end of glory by all the ways of grace, of prudence, and religion.\"",

        "Jerome’s irascible disposition, pride of learning, and extravagant promotion of asceticism involved him in many bitter controversies over both theological and exegetical questions. Yet he was candid at times in admitting his failings, never ambitious for churchly honors, a militant champion of orthodoxy, an indefatigable worker, and a literary stylist with rare gifts. "

        "Johann Arndt and Jacob Boehme were two of the most prominent Lutheran mystical writers.",
        "Born in Edderitz near Ballenstedt, in Anhalt-Köthen, Johann Arndt (1555-1621) was orphaned at age ten. He began his studies with a divided focus on medicine and divinity. After recovering from a grave illness, he came to look on his life as a gift and felt duty-bound to devote it to God’s service. He turned his attention exclusively to divinity, which he studied in several different German and Swiss universities. ",
        "An irenic spirit, Arndt hoped, like Phillip Melanchthon to help heal the divisions between the Reformed (Calvinist) and Evangelical (Lutheran) branches of Protestantism. Although a diligent pastor, this high aspiration met with continual frustration in his ministry; the posthumous influence of his writing, however, has contributed to this hope by drawing many across theological divides to closer personal union with Christ. ",
        "In Arndt’s major work True Christianity, he seeks to correct an over-emphasis on the legal aspect of salvation (justification by faith) by emphasizing the need for the believer to abide in Christ through personal prayer, scripture-reading, and godliness. This work became a standard manual among German Pietists as well as the Mennonites. Philipp Jakob Spener (1635-17050) looked to Arndt as a forerunner of his work. Similarly, Arndt influenced John Wesley and the birth of Methodism within the Church of England. In the 20th century, Albert Schweitzer called Johann Arndt the the prophet of interior Protestantism. True Christianity has provided a model for countless other devotional texts by both Protestant and Roman Catholic writers. ",
        "Jacob Boehme (1575-1624) was born in Alt Seidenburg to a family of cattle-herders. Deemed too weak for cattle-herding, he was sent to school where he learned to read and write and eventually became apprentice to a shoe-maker. ",
        "He was given to mystical visions, even in his youth. A particularly compelling vision in 1600 led Boehme to write Die Morgenroete im Aufgang (The rising of Dawn). Although he never intended the work for publication, it was circulated among friends and eventually came to the attention of the pastor of Görlitz, who harshly condemned it. It was many years before Boehme took up the pen again. However, in 1618 he began to write and produced a remarkable number of works on mystical theology and cosmology in the six years before his death. While Boehme remained a Lutheran, his theological speculations caused considerable controversy for departing from the Lutheran Orthodoxy of his day. ",
        "Boehme writings influenced the radical pietists, including the Society of Friends (Quakers). William Law (1686-1761) became a great admirer of the German mystic later in his life, and produced an English edition of Boehme’s work. However, this admiration was not uncontroversial; Law's student John Wesley called his writings “sublime nonsense.” Boehme also had a great influence on both German and English Romanticism, most notably William Blake.

In 1723, Bach was appointed cantor of the St. Thomas School in Leipzig and parish musician at both St. Thomas and St. Nicholas churches, where he remained until his death in 1750. ",
        "A man of deep Lutheran faith, Bach’s music was an expression of his religious convictions. Among his many works are included musical interpretations of the Bible, which are his “Passions”. The most famous of these is the “Passion According to St. Matthew.” This composition, written in 1727 or 1729, tells the story of chapters 26 and 27 of the Gospel of Matthew and was performed as part of a Good Friday service.

John was born on June 17th, 1703, and Charles on December 18th, 1707. Of the nineteen Wesley siblings, only ten lived to maturity. Under their mother’s tutelage, all of them were schooled each day in six-hour sessions, always begun and concluded with the singing of psalms. ",
        "Their theological writings and sermons are still widely appreciated, but it is through their hymns—especially those of Charles, who wrote over six thousand of them—that their religious experience, and their Christian faith and life, continue to touch the hearts of many. ",
        "Both Wesleys were educated at Christ Church, Oxford, John later being elected a fellow of Lincoln College, where they gathered a few friends to join a “Holy Club” in strict adherence to the worship and discipline of the Prayer Book, and were thus given the name “Methodists.” John was ordained in 1728 and Charles in 1735. Both were profoundly attached to the doctrine and worship of the Church of England, although they were deeply moved by and critical of the church’s neglect of the poor.  Their affection for the Church of England remained despite abusive opposition to their cause and methods. ",
        "The two brothers went together to Georgia in 1735, John as a missionary of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, and Charles as secretary to James Oglethorpe, the Governor.  The mission was a disaster, and both brothers returned to England, dejected and disappointed.  Shortly after their return home, however, they each experienced an inner conversion. On May 21st, 1738—Pentecost—Charles “felt the Spirit of God striving with his spirit ‘till by degrees He chased away the darkness of unbelief.” Three days later, at a meeting on May 24th in Aldersgate Street in London with a group of Moravians, during a reading of Luther’s Preface to the Epistle to the Romans, John recorded, “I felt my heart strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone, for salvation; and an assurance was given me that he had taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death.” ",
        "So the revival was born.  The two brothers placed a strong emphasis on preaching, and appointed lay people, both men and women, as preachers and evangelists to work together with the clergy in proclaiming the gospel.",
        "The formal separation of the Methodists from the Church of England occurred only after the deaths of the two brothers in London —Charles on March 29th, 1788, and John on March 2nd, 1791.  In recent decades there has been increased cooperation and growth in agreement between Anglicans and Methodists, and growing appreciation for our common heritage."

        "Born in Romania around 365, John Cassian struggled with the problems of living the Christian life in a time when the world seemed to be falling apart. As a young man he traveled to a monastery in Bethlehem and later moved to Egypt, where he sought the tutelageof the great founders of the ascetic movement of the desert, such as Evagrius and Macarius. ",
        "At the heart of desert monasticism was the idea that the image of God in each person, tarnished by sin but not destroyed, yearns to and has the capacity to love God with the purity of heart with which God loves us. Their aim in desert solitude was to rid themselves of the anxieties and distractions that called their attention away from loving God. ",
        "Cassian was initiated into this tradition before political pressures arising from theological controversies forced him to leave Egypt in about 399. After a period in Constantinople, where he was ordained as a deacon, he moved to southern Gaul.  In about 415, founded a house in Marseilles for monks, and later a house for nuns. Though Cassian’s goal, like that of his desert mentors, was the perfection of the individual soul, he insisted that no one should embark on a monastic vocation alone. One should enter a house where others are pursuing the same goal, live according to a time-tested rule, and thereby gain the guidance and companionship of the community. ",
        "Though Cassian remained committed to the desert ideal of individual perfection, his insistence on the necessity of Christian community and loving moderation was the basis for Benedictine monasticism. It was perhaps a paradox that only in community could the Christian soul “lose sight of earthly things in proportion to the inspiration of its purity so that…with the inner gaze of the soul it sees the glorified Jesus coming in the splendor of his majesty.” ",
        "Cassian died in Marseilles around the year 435. "

        "John, called “Chrysostom,” which means “the golden-mouthed,”is regarded as one of the greatest preachers in Christian history. People flocked to hear him. His eloquence was accompanied by an acute sensitivity to the needs of people. He saw preaching as an integral part of pastoral care, and as a medium of teaching. He warned that if a priest had no talent for preaching the Word of God, the souls of those in his charge “will fare no better than ships tossed in the storm.” ",
        "Chrysostom is renowned to this day for his Easter sermon, which continues to be read from pulpits around the world.  It reads in part: “Hell is angry because it has been thwarted! Hell is angry because it has been mocked! Hell is angry because it has been destroyed! It is angry because it has been abolished! It is angry because it has been taken captive! Hell seized a body but it discovered God. It seized earth and it encountered heaven. It seized what it saw and was vanquished by what it did not see. O death, where is thy sting? O hell, where is thy victory?\" ",
        "Chrysostom describes the Christian eucharistic liturgy as a glorious experience, in which all of heaven and earth join together in the worship of God. His treatise On the Priesthood remains a classic manual on the priestly vocation and its demands. The priest, he wrote, mustbe “dignified, but not haughty; awe-inspiring, but kind; affable in his authority; impartial, but courteous; humble, but not servile, strong but gentle ...” ",
        "Chrysostom was particularly eloquent concerning the Christian obligation to care for the poor, saying: “If you cannot remember everything, instead of everything, I beg you, remember this without fail, that not to share our own wealth with the poor is stealing from the poor and deprivation of their means of life, for we do not possess our own wealth but theirs. If we have this attitude, we will certainly offer our money; and by nourishing Christ in poverty here and laying up great profit hereafter, we will be able to attain to the good things that are to come.”",
        "While he was extolled as a preacher and pastor, his fiery temperament was poorly suited to the subtle politics demanded by his ministry as a bishop, and his episcopate was short but tumultuous. He was twice exiled, and he died during the second period of banishment, on September 14th, 407. Thirty-one years later, his remains were brought back to Constantinople, and were buried on January 27th, which thus became the traditional date of his commemoration. "

England and Ireland were incorporated in 1801 and the (Protestant) Church of Ireland became part of the Church of England. Up until 1833, Ireland had twenty-two Anglican bishops and archbishops for a population of about 800,000 persons, a ratio considerably smaller than that of the English dioceses. The “Irish Church Measure” of 1833 would have reduced the number of Anglican bishops and archbishops by ten, amalgamating episcopal oversight to a proportion equal in both countries and savingmoney needed at the parish level.

Though bitterly attacked, his loyalty to his church was unwavering. Within three years of his death at Bournemouth on March 29th, 1866, at age 74, a college bearing his name was established at Oxford “to give an education in strict fidelity to the Church of England.” For Keble, this would have meant dedication to learning in order “to live more nearly as we pray.” "

Mobs threatened both him and his family, believing him to be a secret agent of the Vatican attempting to destroy the Church of England from within. ",

        "John of Damascus was the son of a Christian government official for the Muslim Caliph of Damascus. At an early age, he succeeded his father in this office, but in about 715, he entered the monastery of St. Sabas near Jerusalem. There he devoted himself to an ascetic life and to the study of theology. ",
        "In the same year that John was ordained as a priest, 726, the Byzantine Emperor Leo the Isaurian published his first edict against the Holy Images, which signaled the formal outbreak of the iconoclastic controversy. The edict forbade the veneration of sacred images, or icons, and ordered their destruction. In 729-730, John wrote three “Apologies (or Treatises) against the Iconoclasts and in Defense ofthe Holy Images.” He argued that such images were not idols, for they represented neither false gods nor even the true God in his divine nature; but only saints, or our Lord as a man. He further distinguished between the respect, or veneration (proskynesis), that is properly paid to created beings, and the worship (latreia), that is properly given only to God. ",
        "The Seventh Ecumenical Council, in 787, decreed that crosses, icons, the book of the gospels, and other sacred objects were to receive reverence or veneration, expressed by salutations, incense, and lights, because the honor paid to them passed on to that which they represented. True worship (latreia), however, was due to God alone. ",
        "John also wrote a great synthesis of theology, The Fount of Knowledge, of which the last part, “On the Orthodox Faith,” is best known. To Anglicans, John is perhaps best known as the author of the Easter hymns “Thou hallowed chosen morn of praise” (The Hymnal 1982, #198) “Come, ye faithful, raise the strain” (#199; #200), and “The day of resurrection” (#210).

John received elementary education in an orphanage in Medina del Campo. By the age of seventeen, he had learned carpentry, tailoring, sculpturing, and painting through apprenticeships to local craftsmen. ",

John was seized, taken to Toledo, and imprisoned in the monastery. During nine months of great hardship, he comforted himself by writing poetry. It was while he was imprisoned that he composed the greater part of his luminous masterpiece, The Spiritual Canticle, as well as a number of shorter poems. His other major works include The Ascent of Mount Carmel, The Living Flame of Love, and The Dark Night. It is this latter work, Noche obscura del alma, that gave the English language the phrase “dark night of the soul.” ",

After graduating from Cornell University in 1888, Mott became student secretary of the International Committee of the YMCA and chairman of the executive committee of the Student Volunteer Movement. In 1895, he became General Secretary of the World Student Christian Federation, and, in 1901, he was appointed the Assistant General Secretary of the YMCA. During World War I, President Woodrow Wilson appointed him to the National War Work Council, for which he received the Distinguished Service Medal. ",
        "His ecumenical work was rooted in the missionary slogan “The Evangelization of the World in this Generation.” Convinced of the need for better cooperation among Christian communions in the global mission field, he served as chairman of the committee that organized the International Missionary Conference in Edinburgh in 1910, over which he also presided. Considered to be the broadest gathering of Christians up to that point, the Conference marked the beginning of the modern ecumenical movement. ",
        "Speaking before that Conference, Mott summed up his view of Christian missions: “It is a startling and solemnizing fact that even as late as the twentieth century, the Great Command of Jesus Christ to carry the Gospel to all mankind is still so largely unfulfilled…The church is confronted today, as in no preceding generation, with a literally worldwide opportunity to make Christ known.” Mott continued his involvement in the developing ecumenical movement, participating in the Faith and Order Conference at Lausanne in 1927, and was Vice-President of the Second World Conference on Faith and Order in Edinburgh (1937). He also served as Chairman of the Life and Work Conference in Oxford, also held in 1937. ",
        "In 1946, he received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in establishing and strengthening international organizations which worked for peace. The World Council of Churches, the founding of which was largely driven by Mott’s efforts, elected him its life-long Honorary President in 1948. Although Mott was a Methodist, the Episcopal Church recognized his work by making him an honorary canon of the National Cathedral. Mott died in 1955. "

He was made an archbishop in 1925 and sent as the papal envoy to Bulgaria, where he was responsible for reducing the tensions between Eastern Rite and Latin Rite Catholics during a difficult period. Some years later, he was the papal representative to Greece and Turkey when anti-religious sentiments were running high.

Attracted to medicine, ordained ministry, law, and writing, he found himself close to a loss of faith until his discernment was clarified by a profound conversion on Easter Day 1962 at the Church of the Advent in Boston. Jonathan then entered the Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. ",
        "In March of 1965, the televised appeal of Martin Luther King, Jr. to come to Selma to secure for all citizens the right to vote touched Jonathan’s passions for the well-being of others, the Christian witness of the church, and political justice. His conviction was deepened at Evening Prayer during the singing of the Magnificat: “He hath put down the mighty from their seat and hath exalted the humble and meek. He hath filled the hungry with good things.” He wrote: “I knew that I must go to Selma. The Virgin’s song was to grow more and more dear to me in the weeks ahead.” ",

Greatly moved by what he saw and experienced, he returned to seminary, asked leave to work in Selma while continuing his studies, and returned there under the sponsorship of the Episcopal Society for Cultural and Racial Unity.

        "After a brief return to Cambridge in May to complete his exams, he returned to Alabama to resume his efforts assisting those engaged in the integration struggle. Jailed on August 14th for joining a picket line, Jonathan and his companions resolved to remain together until bail could be posted for all of them, as it was six days later. Released and aware that they were in danger, four of them walked to a small store. As sixteen-year-old Ruby Sales reached the top step of the entrance, a man with a shotgun appeared, cursing her. Jonathan pulled her to one side to shield her from the unexpected threats and was killed instantly by the 12-gauge blast. ",

He writes, “The doctrine of the creeds,the enacted faith of the sacraments, were the essential preconditionsof the experience itself. The faith with which I went to Selma has not changed: it has grown…I began to know in my bones and sinews that I had been truly baptized into the Lord’s death and resurrection…with them, the black men and white men, with all life, in him whose Name is above all the names that the races and nations shout…We are indelibly and unspeakably one.” "

        "Julian had been gravely ill and was given last rites.  Suddenly, on the seventh day, all pain left her, and she had fifteen visions of Christ’s Passion. These brought her great peace and joy. “From that time I desired oftentimes to learn what was our Lord’s meaning,” she wrote, “and fifteen years after I was answered in spiritual understanding: ‘Would you learn the Lord’s meaning in this thing? Learn it well. Love was his meaning. Who showed it you? Love. What did he show you? Love. Why did he show it? For Love.”",
        "Julian had long desired three gifts from God: “the mind of hispassion, bodily sickness in youth, and three wounds—of contrition,of compassion, of will-full longing toward God.” Her illness brought her the first two wounds, which then passed from her mind. The third, “will-full longing” (divinely inspired longing), never left her. ",
        "She became a recluse, an anchoress, at Norwich soon after her recovery from illness, living in a small dwelling attached to parish church. Even in her lifetime, she was famed as a mystic and spiritual counselor and was frequently visited by clergy and lay persons, including the mystic Margery Kempe. Kempe saysof Julian: “This anchoress was expert in knowledge of our Lord and could give good counsel. I spent much time with her talking of the love of our Lord Jesus Christ.” ",
        "Julian understood that God was both Father and Mother to us, and understood Christ as exemplifying this maternal face of God.  “Thus Jesus Christ, who does good against evil, is our very Mother.  We have our being in him, where the ground of motherhood begins…As truly as God is our Father, so truly is God our Mother.”",

Like Augustine after him, he was left restless by all this knowledge. During a walk along the beach at Ephesus, he began speaking with a stranger, who told him about Christ. “Straightway a flame was kindled in my soul,” he writes, “and a love of the prophets and those who are friends of Christ possessed me.” He became a Christian as a result of this encounter, and thereafter regarded Christianity as the only “safe and profitable philosophy.” ",

Three of his works survive: a dialogue in Platonic style with a Jew named Trypho, and two apologies in defense of the Christian faith.  Justin’s First and Second Apologies defend Christianity against the Greek charge of irrationality and against the Roman charge of disloyalty to the empire. These two works provide us with important insights into the developing theological ideas and liturgical practices of early Christianity. ",

As the custom was, Rusticus gave them an opportunity to renounce their faith. All steadfastly refused to do so. Justin and his students were all put to death around the year 167. "

The year before, Honolulu, and especiallyits native Hawaiians, had been horribly afflicted by smallpox. The people, accustomed to a royalty which ruled with pomp and power, were confronted instead by a king and queen who went about, “with notebook in hand,” soliciting from rich and poor the funds to build a hospital. Queen’s Hospital, named for Emma, is now the largest civilian hospital in Hawaii. ",

The king’s interest came through a boyhood tour of England where he had seen, in the stately beauty of Anglican liturgy, a quality that seemed attuned to the gentle beauty of the Hawaiian spirit. England responded by sending the Rt. Rev. Thomas N. Staley and two priests. They arrived on October 11, 1862, and the king and queen were confirmed a month later, on November 28, 1862. They then began preparations for a cathedral and school, and the king set about to translate the Book of Common Prayer and much of the hymnal. ",

Kamahameha seemed unable to survive his sadness, although a sermon he preached after his son’s death expresses a hope and faith that is eloquent and profound. His own death took place only a year after his son’s, in 1863. Emma declined to rule; instead, she committed her life to good works. She was responsible for schools, churches, and efforts on behalf of the poor and sick.

        "According to three Byzantine chroniclers, when Emperor Michael II of Amorion died, his son Theophilos succeeded him. To find a suitable empress for Theophilos, a “bride show” of eligible maidens was arranged, Kassiani amongst six finalists. In an ancient custom involving the exchange of a golden apple, Theophilos approached Kassiani saying, “From woman [Eve] came our corruption.” Kassiani coolly replied, “But from woman [the virgin Mary] also came our exaltation.” Her bold response evidently proved too much for Theophilos, who then moved past her to offer the apple to Theodora. ",
        "After her rejection by Theophilos, Kassiani immediately embraced the monastic life- with what seemed more relief than disappointment at her narrow escape from becoming empress. Among her pursuits as a nun include musical and literary accomplishments of distinction, courageous defenses of the veneration of icons, and the founding of a new convent.  She was actively involved in the theological controversies of her day, and an Iambic verse she penned denotes her bravery: “I hate silence, when it is time to speak.”",
        "By 843, Kassiani had built a convent on Xerólophos, the seventh hill of Constantinople, becoming its first abbess. Most notably, however, Kassiani was a prolific hymnographer and poet. Hundreds of poems and approximately fifty of her hymns are extant, including both her musical compositions and lyrics; of those, at least twenty-three hymns are included in Orthodox liturgical books. The most famous, the Hymn of Kassiani, is sung in the Orthodox Church on the eve of Holy Wednesday. "

        "As a young woman, however, Katharina became increasingly critical of many of the abuses that she perceived in the church, and became keenly interested in the movements of ecclesiastical reform.  In 1523, she and 11 others sisters secretly contacted Martin Luther and asked for his help in escaping from the convent.  Smuggled out in a fish wagon, they soon found that they had nowhere to go, because their families refused to take them back.  Several of the Protestant reformers sheltered the women, and Katharina found a temporary home with the family of the famous painter Lucas Cranach.",
        "Eventually all of the women found husbands within the new community of church reformers, but for Katharina no match was found.  Most of her potential suitors found her intellect intimidating and her assertiveness off-putting.  Eventually, she expressed a desire to wed Martin Luther himself, and rather to the surprise of most of his friends, he agreed.  ",
        "Many within the early Lutheran community were opposed to Luther’s marriage, fearing that it would open him to criticism that he had only left the monastic life because he did not want to fulfill his vow of celibacy, rather than because he was genuinely concerned about abuses within the church.  But Luther came to believe that married life was itself a vocation from God, and also that clerical marriage gave women the opportunity to assist in the work of the Reformation as coworkers and colleagues.",
        "Katharina therefore became an early model for the vocation of a pastor’s spouse, assisting Martin in his ministry and providing hospitality to many, as well as raising six children and opening their home to a number of orphans.  The family regularly hosted dozens of people at dinner, which would involve heated theological debates.  Katharina was an active participant in these, knowing both the scriptures and Latin as well as many of the men, and Martin encouraged her contributions.  He gave her a degree of authority that was unprecedented in that time, including allowing her to handle the publication of his works, and naming her as his sole heir upon his death.

Reform and protest against abuses in the church reached her part of the world early on, and the twelve-person Schutz family—artisans, not nobility—were convinced. Katharina was especially interested in the new thinking and teaching about the church. She was intent on seeking a holy life; for a long time, this meant a dedicated celibacy, but as a Protestant, she was convinced of the holiness of marriage as a vocation, and late in 1523 she married Matthew Zell, the most popular priest and preacher in Strasbourg.",
        "For clergy to marry was truly a startling thing for Christians in this time; even some of the new Protestant Christians found it difficult, distasteful, or immoral. In response to the city’s reaction, Zell wrote a letter to the bishop building a Biblical defense of the marriage of priests, and describing the traits of a good pastor. Though she wanted to publish it, she accepted the city council’s demand to keep quiet. In September of 1524, however, she published a pamphlet addressed to her fellow (lay) Christians explaining the Biblical basis for clerical marriage and for her ability (as a woman) to speak on such things. She argues that when a Christian speaks out in this way, it is significant as an act of love to her neighbor.",
        "That same year, 150 men and their families were driven out of Kentzingen because of their beliefs; Katharina and her husband purportedly welcomed 80 of these people in their home. She wrote a “Letter to the suffering women of the Community of Kentzingen, who believe in Christ, sisters with me in Jesus Christ,” in which she interpreted these women’s painful experiences in light of Scripture and the promises of Christ, in order to encourage them on their path.",

Some of her guests were more well-known than others; she welcomed Martin Bucer (who had performed her marriage) when he fled Weissenburg, and John Calvin when he fled France.",
        "She also continued to write throughout her life—a funeral oration for her husband, pamphlets, letters (including a correspondence with Luther), and Scriptural commentary. Her last published work was a commentary on Psalm 50, Psalm 130, and the Lord’s Prayer.",
        "When, later in life, she was accused by her husband’s successor of disturbing the peace of the city, she wrote, “Do you call this disturbing the peace that instead of spending my time in frivolous amusements I have visited the plague infested and carried out the dead? I have visited those in prison and under sentence of death. Often for three days and nights I have neither eaten or slept. I have never mounted the pulpit, but I have done more than any minister in visiting those in misery. Is this disturbing the peace of the church?”"

He was respected by many as an ideal model of a bishop at a time when bishops were generally held in low esteem. As his student, John Hacket, later Bishop of Lichfield, wrote about him: “Indeed he was the most Apostolical and Primitive-like Divine, in my Opinion, that wore a Rochet in his Age; of a most venerable Gravity, and yet most sweet in all Commerce; the most Devout that I ever saw, when he appeared before God; of such a Growth in all kind of Learning that very able Clerks were of a low Stature to him.”  He died in 1626.

Weakened by barbarian invasions and by a totally inefficient economic and political system, the structure that had been carefully built by Augustus had become a chaos of internal warfare, subversion, and corruption.",
        "The social and political situation notwithstanding, Leo received a good education, and was ordained as a deacon, with the responsibility of looking after church possessions, managing the distribution of food, and generally administering the finances. He won considerable respect for his abilities, and a contemporary of his, Cassian, described him as “the ornament of the Roman Church and the divine ministry.”",
        "In 440, Leo was unanimously elected Pope, despite the fact that he was absent at the time on a mission in Gaul. His ability as a preacher shows clearly in the 96 sermons still extant, in which he expounds doctrine, encourages almsgiving, and refutes various heresies.",
        "In Gaul, Africa, and Spain, Leo’s strong hand was felt, as he issued orders to limit the powers of one over-presumptuous bishop, confirmed the rights of another bishop over his vicars, and selected candidates for holy orders. Leo’s letter to the Council of Chalcedon in 451 dealt so effectively with the doctrine of the human and divine natures of the One Person of Christ that the assembled bishops declared, “Peter has spoken by Leo,” and affirmed his definition as orthodox teaching.

Unable to prevent pillaging by the barbarians, he did dissuade them from burning the city and slaughtering its inhabitants.

His mother and regent, Blanche of Castile, inspired his early religious exercises of devotion and asceticism. At age 20, Louis married Margaret of Provence, who bore him 11 children, 9 of whom lived past infancy. Blanche remained a major influence on her son Louis IX until her death in 1252. ",
        "A man of unusual purity of life and manners, he was sincerely committed to his faith and to its moral demands. Living simply, dressing plainly, visiting hospitals, helping the poor, and acting with integrity and honesty, Louis IX believed that the crown was given him by God and that God would hold him accountable for his reign. ",
        "A deplorable aspect of medieval Christianity was its anti-Semitism, and despite his attempts to cultivate holiness, Louis IX was complicit in official action against Jewish believers. Louis ordered the expulsion of all Jews engaged in usury and the confiscation of their propertyto finance his crusade. At the urging of Pope Gregory IX, Louis also ordered the burning in Paris in 1243 of some 12,000 manuscript copies of the Talmud and other Jewish books and increased the power and authority of the Inquisition in France.

In an act customary of the piety and politics of his time and culture, he vowed that if he recovered he would lead a Crusade against the Muslims.   Leavinghis mother Blanche in charge of the kingdom, Louis led the Seventh Crusade fortified with 36 ships and 15,000 soldiers, including two of his brothers. They began with an attack upon Damietta in Egypt, where Louis won an easy victory in June 1249 that quickly led to disaster as the troops progressed to Cairo. The Egyptian army was numerically superior, the French troops ravaged with famine and disease that forced the Crusaders back to Damietta. But on the way, the Egyptians defeated Louis at Fariskur on April 6th 1250, and he was taken captive. Released only after paying a very large ransom, Louis then went to Acre, where he engaged in a series of fruitless negotiations. When the money ran out, and learning of the death of his mother, Louis IX went home to France. ",
        "Back in France, Louis’ piety inspired his patronage of the arts and encouraged the spread of Gothic architecture. One of his most notable commissions is Sainte-Chapelle (“Holy Chapel”), located within the royal palace complex in the center of Paris, erected as a shrine for the Crown of Thorns and a fragment of the True Cross, precious relics of the Passion of Jesus that Louis had purchased in 1239–41 for a sum twice the total cost of the chapel itself.

        "Macrina the younger (340–379) was a monastic, theologian, and teacher. She is described as having lived a “philosophical life” and she founded one of the earliest Christian monastic communities in the Cappadocian countryside, on the crossroad of Annisa. Macrina left no writings; we know of her through the works of her brother, Gregory of Nyssa. Gregory used the Life of Macrina not only to preserve the memory of his renowned sister, but also as a template in which to flesh out a practical theology of Christian holiness and union with God that supplements his more theoretical works. ",
        "Gregory relates that when Macrina’s prospective fiancé died, she refused to marry anyone else because of her conviction that there is but one marriage and because of her “hope in the resurrection.” This hope was the basis of her monastic, that is, her philosophical, life. Although he says that she, like other philosophers, chose to live “on her own”, Gregory immediately describes how Macrina lived as a student and servant to her mother, Emilia. He goes on to show Macrina taking a leadership role when she persuades her mother to join her by living on the same level as their servants. In setting out Macrina’s relationship with her brother, Peter, Gregory also shows the mutuality of Christian community. He not only describes Macrina as being everything to Peter – father, mother, and teacher of all good things – but Peter as being the person from whom Macrina learned the most.",
        "Gregory credits Macrina with being the spiritual and theological intelligence behind her brothers’ notable leadership in the church. She is shown challenging them, telling Gregory that his fame was not due to his own merit, but to the prayers of his parents, and taking Basil in hand when he returned from Athens “monstrously conceited about his skill in rhetoric.” Notably, although Gregory and Basil, as well as Peter, became bishops, in the Life, it is Macrina who is portrayed saying a priestly, and thoroughly liturgical, prayer. ",
        "Gregory visited Macrina as she lay dying. It is only at this point in the story that he unveils how the hope of the resurrection with which Macrina began her philosophical life after the death of her fiancé was the inspiration for her decisions to free slaves and the reason why she could cross over otherwise firmly established gender divisions. He shows, too, that her belief in one marriage and her hope of union with her fiancé was, in fact, ultimately a striving towards the true bridegroom, Jesus Christ. In both his Life of Macrina and in his later treatise On the Soul and Resurrection, Gregory presents Macrina admiringly as a Christian Socrates, delivering eloquent deathbed prayers and teachings about the resurrection. This presentation of Macrina by Gregory serves as one sort of “Rule”. Basil also wrote a formal monastic rule for community life, ensuring that Macrina’s ideas for Christian community would have lasting authority through the centuries. "

Trading her costly array for a simple brown dress, she made her home into a house of prayer and refuge. Her example inspired other women to form a community, sometimes called the Brown Dress Society, that was devoted to chastity, poverty, fasting, prayer, studying the scriptures, and serving the poor and needy. Together with Paula (September 28th), Marcella is one of the mothers of Roman monasticism. ",
        "In 382, Pope Damasus invited Jerome to Rome, where he lodged in Marcella’s Aventine Hill estate. During those three years a friendship developed between Marcella, Paula, and Jerome, without which Jerome’s Latin translation of the scriptures (later called the Vulgate) would not have been written. Marcella and Paula were both remarkably erudite; Jerome found in them not only friends but colleagues with whom to discuss the challenges of interpreting and translating the scriptures. After the death of Damasus, Jerome, joined by Paula and her daughter Eustochium, left for Jerusalem; although they urged Marcella to join them, she was determined to remain in Rome. She and Jerome corresponded for the remainder of her life. After his departure, scholars came to her to seek her insight on obscure matters in the Greek and Hebrew scriptures. ",
        "In 410 the Visigoths invaded Rome. Alaric’s soldiers pillaged Marcella’s home in search of wealth. They scourged the eighty-five year old woman, demanding that she surrender her hidden treasures, all of which she had long since spent in charity. She only pleaded with the soldiers not to harm her protégé Principia. They were both eventually taken to St. Paul’s Church, which had been designated a sanctuary.  The following day, Marcella died in Principia’s arms.  "

        "Margaret's story is one that raises questions at each of the many turns it took.  She was born into a farming family outside the village of Laviano, near Perugia.  Her mother died when she was a child and after her father remarried, there was enough tension in her home that she ran away.  The various accounts of her life remark on her beauty and suggest it might have been jealousy that created ill feelings in her stepmother.   With the burden of grief and discomfort in her home, it is not surprising that she turned outside her home for affection from those attracted to her for her beauty.   ",
        "At some point, she left her home and native village and took a position as a servant in a wealthy man’s home.  When he took her as his mistress, it was with a promise that he would marry her. She bore him a son, and despite that obligation, he still held back from the unlikely marriage of a nobleman with a farm-girl. She continued to live with him in apparent luxury, though without the stability and respect that marriage would have provided. Where previous perspectives might have seen a loose, if not scheming woman, it is perhaps just as obvious that this was a young woman seeking a place of acceptance and safety whose trust was misplaced in the man with whom she sought to build a life.  ",
        "That all came to an end at his death.  He had been away, either on a journey or out hunting, and his dog returned without him.  The dog led Margaret to the place where her child’s father was buried, the victim of murder.   In her grief, Margaret decided to return to her father’s house.  He refused to admit her and her native village turned its back on her.  In grief and abandonment, she took her son and sought a refuge with the Franciscans.   They found her a home with devout women who provided a home for such cases.  After three years of probation, she became a Tertiary of the Franciscans and her son eventually became a Friar.  She spent the balance of her life following a strict pattern of life and an intense spiritual life dedicated to the Passion of Christ and his Presence in the Eucharist.  ",
        "Her own experience led her to establish a hospital and home for those in need, and she gathered a group of women to live together in the religious life and to serve as nurses.  She also took an active role in public life, twice challenging the Bishop of Arezzo, for his warlike and extravagant lifestyle.   She died on February 22nd, 1297.",

She insisted that the observance of Lent, for example, was to begin on Ash Wednesday, rather than on the following Monday, and that the Mass should be celebrated according to the accepted Roman Rite.

In 1906, after the death of her father, her mother took the family to St. Petersburg, where she became involved in radical intellectual circles. After her divorce from her first husband, she was drawn to Christianity. She married her second husband, Daniel Skobtsov, and they emigrated to Paris in 1923. Three years later, her youngest child died, and she separated from her second husband. After this, Liza began to work more directly with those who were in need.",
        "In 1932, Liza’s bishop encouraged her to take vows as a nun, which she did taking the name, Maria. She realized that Christian asceticism was not primarily about self-mortification and the cloistered life, but responding with love to the needs of others while trying to create better social structures. She could often be found sitting along the Boulevard Montparnasse, in front of a café, with a glass of beer, smoking cigarettes, and talking with simple workers in full monastic robes.  Maria made a rented house in Paris her “convent.” It was a place with an open door for refugees, the needy and the lonely. It also soon became a center for intellectual and theological discussion. For Maria, these two elements—service to the poor and theology—went hand-in-hand. ",

Many came to her hoping to receive baptismal certificates, which they believed would prevent their deportation. Her chaplain, Father Dimitri, gladly provided them. As the occupation became more dangerous, the community hid more Jewish people, providing shelter and helping many to escape. Eventually, this work of the community was discovered by the Gestapo. Maria, her son Yuri, her mother Sophia, and Dmitri Klepinin were all taken into custody. ",

In time, however, a local girl who had become pregnant accused Marinos of fathering her child.  Rather than respond to this accusation with the obvious denial, Marinos accepted responsibility rather than reveal his secret or subject the girl to further reproach.  When the child was born, the infant was given to Marinos to raise at the monastery, and he accepted the boy as though he were truly his own son, and bore patiently all of the scorn and abuse that the other monks heaped upon him for his alleged violation of his monastic vows.",
        "After many years Marinos also died, and it was only when the monks went to prepare the body for burial that they discovered it was actually the body of a woman, who had obviously been innocent of the accusation of having fathered a child.  The monks and villagers lamented their false accusation and judgment, and after their repentance many miracles were performed at Marina’s tomb.",

Luther’s real calling lay elsewhere, however, and in 1505, he entered the local Augustinian monastery. He was ordained as a priest on April 3rd, 1507. ",
        "In October 1512, Luther received his doctorate in theology, and shortly afterward he was installed as a professor of biblical studies at the University of Wittenberg. His lectures on the Bible were popular, and within a few years he made the university a center for biblical humanism. As a result of his theological and biblical studies, he called into question the practice of selling indulgences. On the eve of All Saints’ Day, October 31st, 1517, he posted on the door of the castle church in Wittenberg the notice of an academic debate on indulgences, listing 95 theses for discussion. As the effects of the theses became evident, the pope called upon the Augustinian order to discipline their member. After a series of meetings, political maneuvers, and attempts at reconciliation, Luther, at a meeting with the papal legate in 1518, refused to recant. ",

There Luther resisted all efforts to make him recant, insisting that he had to be proved in error on the basis of Scripture. The Diet passed an edict calling for the arrest of Luther. Luther’s own prince, the Elector Frederick of Saxony, however, had him spirited away and placed for safekeeping in his castle. ",
        "There Luther translated the New Testament into German and began the translation of the Old Testament. He then turned his attentionto the organization of worship and education. He introduced congregational singing of hymns, composing many himself, and issued model orders of services. He published his large and small catechisms for instruction in the faith. During the years from 1522 to his death, Luther wrote a prodigious quantity of books, letters, sermons, and tracts. Luther died at Eisleben on February 18th, 1546. "

Without minimizing the seriousness of the theological disagreements or the inextricable links between religion and politics in that time, this commemoration asks us to recognize that within the heritage of our own tradition there were both victims and persecutors, and that there was a deeply Christian courage and holiness present in the martyrs from various confessions who were willing to die for their faith.  It is a sobering reminder of just how swiftly Christians have often turned from being persecuted and oppressed to being the persecutors and the oppressors of others.  ",

In this case, Jesus’ words that Mary “has chosen the better part” are meant to reassure Martha that her sister is on the right track, and that when she is ready, she too will eventually move on from only seeking spiritual consolation to serving where she is needed.

        "Maryam of Qidun is one of the most popular Syriac Christian saints.  The drama of her life story easily lends itself to fictionalized interpretations, and multiple accounts of her life were produced.  There nevertheless does seem to be a historical person in the background of all of these accounts, who became the inspiration for all of these legends.",
        "Maryam grew up in a Christian family and was orphaned at the age of 7.  Her only living relative was an uncle named Abraham who lived as a hermit in the desert near Qidun, a village outside of Edessa.  Despite the seeming oddity of an anchorite serving as the guardian for a young girl, therefore, she was given to him to raise.  For twenty years, she lived an ascetic life in her own room in his dwelling, growing deeply in holiness and prayer, teaching those who came to seek her wisdom through a window, and being praised and admired by all who met her.",
        "However, there was a monk who desired her, and who used to come to the hermitage every day on the pretext of speaking with Abraham in order to see her.  One day when her uncle was out, the monk seduced her.  Afterwards, she fell into despair about the possibility of her salvation, for she had always been admired for her purity and holiness, and had felt secure in those things.  Deeply shaken, she thought: “How can I ever again raise my eyes up to heaven when I cannot even bring myself to look at my uncle?” Rather than face him and confess her sin to him, she ran away to the city and began to work as a prostitute in a tavern.  ",
        "After two years of frantic searching, her uncle discovered where she was living, and he borrowed a soldier’s uniform and a horse.  He covered his face with the helm, and set off for the tavern.  When he saw her dressed as a prostitute and flirting with the customers he wanted to weep, but he concealed his emotions lest she recognize him and run away.  Although he had not touched wine or cooked food in nearly fifty years, he feasted and drank and joked as though he were truly a soldier.  But when the girl led him back to her bedroom he took off his helm and said, “My daughter Maryam, don’t you know me?  Whatever has happened to you? Why did you not just tell me when you had sinned? I would not have been angry with you, for who is without sin, except for God alone? I would have done penance for you myself, yet instead you have left me all alone in unspeakable sadness and grief.” ",
        "As he spoke these words, she was like a motionless stone in his hands, too ashamed and afraid even to speak or to raise her eyes to his. But he spoke words of comfort and compassion to her all night, and in the morning she allowed him to lead her home, where she pleased God more by her sincere repentance than she ever had by her virginity, and where she was able to direct others more wisely because she was able to identify with sinners in their weakness rather than looking down on them from a place of purity."

Typically, Beguines lived in a communal house and supported themselves through their own work, such as nursing, weaving, embroidery, burial of the dead, and housework. ",

Her older sister was already the abbess of a convent, and when Mechthilde was 7 years old the family went to visit her.  Mechthilde was so enchanted with the convent, particularly its extensive library, that she refused to go home again, and her parents eventually yielded to her pleas.  In the convent, Mechthilde received a superb education, and eventually directed both the convent choir and its library, illuminating manuscripts and writing her own original works.  In time, the convent was transferred to her family’s estate at Helfta as it continued to grow.",

She writes in fluent Latin, and shows extensive familiarity with the Scriptures, early Christian authorities such as Augustine and Gregory the Great, and even more contemporary theologians, including Bernard of Clairvaux, Richard and Hugh of St. Victor, and William of St. Thierry.   She was given the title “Gertrude the Great” because she was among the most prominent theological writers of her age, either male or female.",

Early in their marriage Patricius could be violent and abusive, although over the course of their life together he seems to have worked to improve his temper. In Monica’s earlier years she was not without worldly ambitions and tastes, and in particular she struggled with a tendency to drink too much wine– a temptation that she gradually overcame. Over time, she grew in Christian maturity and spiritual insight through an ever-deepening life of prayer. ",

Augustine took a particularly slow and circuitous path to Christianity, but Monica never gave up hope for his conversion.  After his baptism in Milan in 387 by Bishop Ambrose, Augustine and his mother, together with a younger brother, planned to return home to Africa. While awaiting ship at Ostia, the port of Rome, however, Monica fell ill. ",

We hurried to her bedside, but she soon regained consciousness and looked up at my brother and me as we stood beside her.

Do not let that worry you. All I ask of you is that, wherever you may be, you should remember me at the altar of the Lord.” To the question of whether she was afraid at the thought of leaving her body in an alien land, she replied, “Nothing is far from God, and I need have no fear that he will not know where to find me, when he comes to raise me to life at the end of the world.” ",

They restored the derelict church near the manor house, became responsible for services there, taught many of the local children, and looked after the health and well-being of the people of the neighborhood. A regular round of prayer according to the Book of Common Prayer was observed, along with the daily recital of the whole of the psalter. The members of the community became widely known for fasting, private prayer and meditation, and for writing stories and books illustrating themes of Christian faith and morality.  The community also prepared “harmonies” of the gospels, one of which was presented to King Charles I by the Ferrar family. ",

When the monks were building their first monastery, the local bishop came with a mob to try to tear it down.  Others came to respect the monks and their way of life, but wanted to unite them more closely to official church institutions.  The bishops Serapion and Athanasius visited the community with the hope of ordaining Pachomius to the priesthood, but he hid from them until they finally went away. Indeed, the life of Pachomius states that originally “he did not want any clergy in his monasteries at all for fear of jealousy and vainglory.”  In time, however, the new monastic movement and the church hierarchy developed a mutual respect for the differing gifts and responsibilities that each of them bore within the church. ",
        "By the time that Pachomius died, his monastic federation included several thousand monks and nuns, and within a generation the monastic movement would spread from Egypt to Palestine, Turkey, and Western Europe."

      "bio": [
        "Patrick was born into a Christian family somewhere on the northwest coast of Britain around 390. His grandfather had been a Christian priest and his father, Calpornius, a deacon. Calpornius was an important official in the late Roman imperial government of Britain. ",
        "When Patrick was about sixteen, he was captured by a band of Irish slave-raiders. He was carried off to Ireland and forced to serve as a shepherd. When he was about twenty-one, he escaped and returned to Britain, where he was educated as a Christian. He tells us that he was ordained as both priest and bishop, although no particular see is known as his at this time. A vision then called him to return to Ireland, and he did so around the year 431. ",
        "Tradition holds that Patrick landed not far from the place of his earlier captivity, near what is now known as Downpatrick (a “down” or “dun” is a fortified hill, the stronghold of a local Irish king). He then began a remarkable process of missionary conversion throughout the country that continued until his death, probably in 461. He made his appeal to the local kings and through them to their tribes. Christianizing the old pagan religion as he went, Patrick erected Christian churches over sites already regarded as sacred, had crosses carved on old druidic pillars, and put sacred wells and springs under the protection of Christian saints. ",
        "Many legends of Patrick’s Irish missionary travels possess substrata of truth, especially those telling of his conversion of the three major Irish High Kings. At Armagh, he is said to have established his principal church. To this day, Armagh is regarded as the primatial see of all Ireland. ",
        "Two works are attributed to Patrick: an autobiographical Confession, in which he tells us, among other things, that he was criticized byhis contemporaries for lack of learning, and a Letter to Coroticus, a British chieftain. The Lorica or St. Patrick’s Breastplate (“I bind unto myself today”) was probably not written by him, dating most probably from the 8th century rather than from the 5th, but it does express his faith and zeal.

After graduating from Yale University and the Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he accepted a call to serve a mission in Logan, Utah. In 1914, he was appointed archdeacon of the Missionary District of Utah and, later that year, was elected its bishop. Meanwhile, World War I had begun. ",
        "As Bishop of Utah, Paul Jones did much to expand the church’s mission stations and to strengthen diocesan institutions. At the same time, he spoke openly about his opposition to war. With the entry of the United States into the war, the Bishop of Utah’s views became increasingly controversial. At a meeting of the Fellowship of Reconciliation in Los Angeles in 1917, Bishop Jones expressed his belief that “war is unchristian,” for which he was attacked with banner headlines in the Utah press. ",
        "As a result of the speech and the reaction it caused in Utah, a commission of the House of Bishops was appointed to investigatethe situation. In their report, the commission concluded that “The underlying contention of the Bishop of Utah seems to be that war is unchristian. With this general statement the Commission cannot agree…” The report went on to recommend that “The Bishop of Utah ought to resign his office,” thus rejecting Paul Jones’ right to object to war on grounds of faith and conscience. ",
        "In the spring of 1918, Bishop Jones, yielding to pressure, resignedas Bishop of Utah. In his farewell to the Missionary District of Utahin 1918, Bishop Jones said: “Where I serve the Church is of small importance, so long as I can make my life count in the cause of Christ…Expediency may make necessary the resignation of a bishop at this time, but no expedience can ever justify the degradation of the ideals of the episcopate which these conclusions seem to involve.” ",
        "For the rest of his life, he continued a ministry within the church dedicated to peace and conscience, speaking always with a conviction and gentleness rooted in the gospel. Bishop Jones died on September 4th, 1941. "

As Cornelia was the model of a Roman Matron whose sons were her only jewels, so Paula become the model of the Desert Mother whose wealth was surrendered to the service of God. Married at a young age, she had five children and was widowed at age 32. Though she had lived in patrician luxury, after being widowed she was inspired by the example of Marcella (January 31) and devoted her life to the worship of God, rigorous asceticism, and service to the needy. Both Marcella and Paula converted their palaces into monasteries and gathered to them many windows and virgins. ",

Paula and her daughter Eustochium (b. 386) took to the irascible scholar and preacher of asceticism. They became Jerome’s dearest companions and the only antidotes to his infamous wrath. They restrained his temper and frequently recalled him to the mildness and humility that Christ enjoins. While urged by her noble family to marry, Eustochium, under the guidance of Jerome, made a vow of perpetual virginity. Jerome’s famous De custodia virginitatis was written for her instruction. ",
        "Fluent in Greek, Paula and Eustochium were ardent students of the scriptures and they quickly mastered Hebrew under Jerome’s tutelage. When he left to return to the East, Paula and Eustochium followed after him, making a pilgrimage of the Holy Land. The three of them settled in Bethlehem and there Paula had four monasteries erected — one for men, over which Jerome presided, and three for women. ",
        "In Bethlehem, their passion for the study of scripture only grew, and their challenging questions led Jerome to write many of his commentaries. Under Paula’s persuasive and persistent influence, Jerome undertook a new Latin translation of the Bible from the original languages, which came to be known as the Vulgate. Paula also provided the books that were essential to Jerome’s work. She and Eustochium suggested revisions to his translation drafts and edited all his works, and the women of their convents were the scribes who made copies of the finished work available. Paula and Eustochium were Jerome’s colleagues in this work and without them there would be no Vulgate.",
        "Paula presided over the Bethlehem monasteries for twenty years until her death in 404. In his eulogy for her, Jerome wrote: “If all the members of my body were turned into tongues and all my joints were to utter human voices, I should be unable to say anything worthy of the holy and venerable Paula.” After the death of her mother, Eustochium assumed direction of the monasteries. Eustochium died in 419 or 420, her eyes closed by her niece Paula, who took over direction of the monasteries after her death."

After seeking admission to graduate school at the University of North Carolina in 1938, she was denied entry due to her race. She went on to graduate from Howard University Law School in 1944. While a student at Howard, she participated in sit-in demonstrations that challenged racial segregation in drugstores and cafeterias in Washington, DC. Denied admission to Harvard University for an advanced law degree because of her gender, Murray received her Masters of Law from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1945. ",
        "In 1948 the Women’s Division of Christian Service of the Methodist Church hired Murray to compile information about segregation laws in the South. Her research led to a 1951 book, States’ Laws on Race and Color, which became a foundational document for Thurgood Marshall in his work on the decisive Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. ",

        "Early in the third century, Emperor Septimius Severus decreed that all persons should sacrifice to the emperor. Many Christians, confessing faith in the one Lord Jesus Christ, believed that they could not do this. Perpetua, Felicity, and the other catechumens were arrested and held in prison under miserable conditions.  At the public hearing before the proconsul, Perpetua refused even the entreaties of her aged father.  Pointing to a water pot, she asked him, \"See that pot lying there? Can you call it by any other name than what it is?\"  Her father answered, \"Of course not.\" Perpetua responded, \"Neither can I call myself by any name other than what I am - a Christian.\"",
        "Felicity was eight months pregnant at the time they were arrested.  Because pregnant women could not be executed, she was anxious lest the others be executed apart from her, while she would be condemned to die at another time alone.  Two days before the scheduled execution, however, she gave birth to a baby girl, who was adopted and raised by an anonymous Christian woman in Carthage. ",
        "A document that is attributed to Perpetua recounts the visions that she had while in prison. One was of a ladder to heaven, which she climbed to reach a large garden; another was of her brother who had died when young of a dreadful disease, but was now well and drinking the water of life; the last was of herself as a warrior battling the devil and defeating him to win entrance to the gate of life. “And I awoke, understanding that I should fight, not with beasts, but with the Devil.” ",
        "On March 7th, 203, Perpetua and Felicity, encouraging one another to bear bravely whatever pain they might suffer, were sentto the arena to be mangled by a leopard, a boar, a bear, and a savage cow. Perpetua and Felicity, tossed by the cow, were bruised and disheveled, but Perpetua, “lost in spirit and ecstasy,” hardly knew that anything had happened. To her companions she cried, “Stand fast in the faith and love one another. And do not let what we suffer be a stumbling block to you.” ",
        "Eventually, both Perpetua and Felicity were put to death by a stroke of a sword through the throat. The soldier who struck Perpetua was inept. His first blow merely pierced her throat between the bones. She shrieked with pain, then aided the man to guide the sword properly. The report of her death concludes, “Perhaps so great a woman, feared by the unclean spirit, could not have been killed unless she so willed it.”"

Although he would go on to lead several congregations, he was never ordained as a priest because of barriers caused by racism in the Episcopal Church at that time.  The bishop directed him to establish Christ Church for Colored People in San Francisco while Annie kept St. Philip’s going. Later this church would split into the African American Church of St. Cyprian and Christ Nippon Sei Ko Kai (Japanese American Episcopal Church). ",

Sitting by the well to rest, the Lord asked a Samaritan woman who came to the well to draw water to give him a drink. The request violated cultural taboos — a man speaking privately with a woman, and a Jew speaking to a Samaritan — anticipating the theological insight of Galatians 3:28. Their brief encounter is one of notable theological depth in which Jesus makes the first of several important “I am” statements in John’s Gospel. The Samaritan woman had been married five times and was living with a man to whom she was not married.

However, she has the distinct honor of being the first person to whom Jesus reveals his Messianic title and the first person to preach the gospel that Jesus is the Christ. ",

She, her sisters, and her children are said to have been cruelly tortured and martyred at the command of the emperor Nero. ",

        "When Paul came to Corinth (probably in the year 50), he met Priscilla and her husband Aquila.  Like Paul, they were tentmakers by trade, and had just arrived from Rome, from which the Emperor Claudius had recently expelled the Jewish community. It is not clear whether Aquila and Priscilla were already Christians before meeting Paul, or were converted by his preaching. After eighteen months, the three of them went together to Ephesus, where Priscilla and Aquila remained while Paul continued to Antioch. ",
        "Soon after, a man named Apollos came to Ephesus, who had heard and believed a portion of the Christian message, and was promoting that belief with eloquent preaching, based on a thorough knowledge of the Hebrew Scriptures. Aquila and Priscilla befriended him and explained the Gospel to him more fully, after which he continued to preach with even greater effectiveness.",
        "Priscilla and Aquila were apparently in Rome when Paul wrote to that congregation, and in Ephesus with Timothy when Paul wrote his last letter to Timothy. When Paul wrote to the Corinthians from Ephesus, he joined their greetings with his own. Clearly they were dear to Paul, and were earnest and effective in spreading the Good News of Christ and His saving work.",
        "Altogether, Aquila and Priscilla are mentioned six times in the New Testament (Acts 18:2, Acts 18:18-19, Acts 18:26; Romans 16:3; 1 Corinthians 16:19; 2 Timothy 4:19), and the observant reader may note that in half of these Aquila's name comes first, while in the other half, Priscilla's comes first, as if to emphasize that they are being mentioned on equal terms."

        "Remigius, also known as Remi, one of the patron saints of France, was born around 438, the son of the Count of Laon. At the age of twenty- two he became Bishop of Rheims. ",
        "Noted for his learning and holiness of life, Remigius is chiefly remembered because he converted and baptized King Clovis of the Franks on Christmas Day, 496. This event changed the religious history of Europe. By becoming Catholic instead of Arian, as most of the Germanic people were at the time, Clovis was able to unite the Gallo-Roman population and their Christian leaders behind his expanding hegemony over the Germanic rulers of the West and to liberate Gaul from Roman domination. His conversion also made possible the cooperation the Franks gave later to Pope Gregory the Great in his evangelistic efforts for the English. ",
        "Certainly, Clovis’ motives in accepting Catholic Christianity were mixed, but there is no doubt of the sincerity of his decision, nor of the important role of Remigius in bringing it to pass. When Clovis was baptized, together with 3,000 of his followers, Remigius gave him the well-known charge: “Worship what you have burned, and burn what you have worshiped.” ",
        "The feast of Remigius is observed at Rheims on January 13th, possibly the date of his death. The later date of October 1st is derived from the translation of his relics to a new abbey church by Pope Leo IX in 1049. "

After ordination and marriage in 1581, he held a living in Buckinghamshire. In 1586, he became Master of the Temple in London. Later, he served country parishes in Boscombe, Salisbury, and Bishopsbourne near Canterbury. ",
        "A controversy with a noted Puritan led Hooker to prepare a comprehensive defense of the Reformation settlement underQueen Elizabeth I. This work, his masterpiece, was entitled The Lawsof Ecclesiastical Polity. Its philosophical base is Aristotelian, witha strong emphasis upon the natural law eternally planted by God in creation. On this foundation, all positive laws of church and state are grounded—upon Scriptural revelation, tradition, and reason. ",
        "Book Five of the Laws is a massive defense of the Book of Common Prayer, directed primarily against Puritan detractors. Hooker’s arguments are buttressed by enormous patristic learning, but the needs of the contemporary worshiper are paramount, and he draws effectively on his twenty-year experience of using the Prayer Book. ",
        "Concerning the nature of the church, Hooker wrote: “The churchis always a visible society of men; not an assembly, but a society. For although the name of the church be given unto Christian assemblies, although any multitude of Christian men congregated may be termed by the name of a church, yet assemblies properly are rather things that belong to a church. Men are assembled for performance of public actions; which actions being ended, the assembly dissolveth itself and is no longer in being, whereas the church which was assembled doth no less continue afterwards than before.” ",
        "Pope Clement VIII is reported to have said that Hooker’s work “had in it such seeds of eternity that it would abide until the last fire shall consume all learning.” "

        "Richard Meux Benson and Charles Gore are remembered for their role in the revival of Anglican monasticism in the nineteenth century. ",
        "Richard Meux Benson was born in London in 1824.  He was educated at home until he went to Christ Church, Oxford, where he studied under Edward Bouverie Pusey.  He was subsequently ordained as a priest and served as vicar of the village of Cowley, not far from Oxford.  In 1858 Fr. Benson conducted the first of many silent retreats for priests for which he later became well-known.  Also around this time, he established a church dedicated to St. John the Evangelist in Cowley, and made plans to travel to India to gather a community of missionaries to live with him in poverty.  His bishop, however, urged him to stay in England, where the Oxford Movement was spreading.  ",
        "At this time, although there were several Anglican monastic communities for women, there were not yet any communities for men.  Therefore, in 1865, Fr. Benson and Fr. S.W. O’Neill established a community that was both contemplative and externally focused, which they called the Mission Priests of St. John the Evangelist.  It was the first religious order for men in the Church of England since the Reformation. Fr. Benson was named Superior, and as such, developed the Society’s Rule of Life and Constitution.  The brothers recited the Daily Office together, were urged to spend at least an hour in contemplation each day, and continued their priestly ministry outside of the monastery. In the late 1800s the Society spread to the United States, India and South Africa.  Fr. Benson himself visited the community in Cambridge, Massachusetts and remained there for a number of years before returning to England, where he died in 1915.  ",
        "Charles Gore was born in 1853 in Wimbledon and was educated mainly at Oxford. He was ordained in 1876 and served in positions at Cuddesdon and Pusey House, Oxford, both of which were focused upon theological education and the formation of clergy. While at Pusey House, Gore founded the Community of the Resurrection, a community for men that sought to combine the rich traditions of the religious life with a lively concern for the demands of ministry in the modern world.",
        "Gore, a prolific writer and noted theologian, was a principal progenitor of liberal Anglo-Catholicism in late 19th and early 20th century Anglicanism. He was concerned to make available the critical scholarship of the age available to the church, particularly with respect to the Bible. A second but no less important concern was to prick the conscience of the church and plead for its engagement in the work of social justice for all. Between 1902 and 1919, Gore served successively as bishop of the dioceses of Worcester, Birmingham, and Oxford, seamlessly uniting his vocations of bishop, monastic, and theologian.  He died in 1932."

        "Richard Rolle, born in 1290, was an English hermit about whose early life we know little. Although he grew up in a poor farming family, he was sponsored for education at Oxford by the Archdeacon of Durham.  At the age of 18, however, he dropped out of Oxford to live as a hermit, out of which grew a ministry of prayer, writing, and spiritual direction. His writings were among the most widely read works of spirituality in England in the 15th century and include several scriptural commentaries, some theological writings, and many poems. Rolle spent his final years near the Cistercian convent near Hampole, a village in south Yorkshire, where he served as a spiritual director for the nuns. ",
        "We likewise know little about the early life of Walter Hilton beyond his birth in 1340, but evidence suggests that he studied at Cambridge. Hilton spent time as a hermit before becoming an Augustinian canon at Thurgarton Priory in Nottinghamshire in the late fourteenth century. In his great work, The Scale of Perfection, he develops his understanding of the “luminous darkness” which marks the transition between self-love and the love of God.  His writings were influential in England not only in the years leading up to the Reformation, but also during the Oxford Movement.  Evelyn Underhill was greatly drawn to his works and published an updated translation of The Scale of Perfection in modern English in 1923.",
        "Born around 1373, Margery Kempe and her husband John had at least 14 children. She seems to have had no formal education.  Though illiterate, she dictated the Book of Margery Kempe, from which we learn most of our knowledge of her. A mystic who experienced intense visions, she went on pilgrimages to Canterbury, the Holy Land and to Santiago de Compostela. She also visited Julian of Norwich and was encouraged by her.  Her book describes her travels as well as her mystical experiences and her deep compassion for sinners. ",
        "These three writers of vernacular English mysticism, together with the anonymous authors of The Cloud of Unknowing and the Ancrene Wisse, all exerted a great influence on later English and Anglican spiritual writings."

        "He was appointed Master of the Oxford School, and teacherof theology to the Franciscans when they established a house at Oxford.  Grosseteste translated Aristotle’s works from the Greek, wrote commentaries on them, and sought to refute the philosopher’s views by developing a scientific method based on Augustine’s theories. Because of Grosseteste, Oxford began to emphasize the study of the sciences, especially physics, geometry, and mathematics. One notable pupil of Grosseteste was Roger Bacon, a brilliant proponent of the scientific method. Both as a teacher and as a bishop, Grosseteste had a strong influence on John Wycliffe. ",
        "In 1235, Grosseteste was consecrated as Bishop of Lincoln. He exercised his office with efficiency and conscientiousness, remarking that a bishop’s pastoral responsibility was not merely to give instructions but to see that they were carried out. “I am obligated to visit the sheep committed to me with all diligence, as Scripture prescribes,” he said. ",
        "He traveled regularly to each rural deanery, called together the clergy and laity, preached, confirmed, and dealt with questions of doctrine. “My lord, you are doing something new and exceptional,” remarked some of the people during his first visitation. He replied, “Every new thing which implants and promotes and perfects the new man, corrupts and destroys the old. Blessed is the new, and in every way welcome to him who comes to recreate the old man in newness.” ",
        "Grosseteste actively opposed royal infringements on church liberties and he did not fear to protest even papal abuses of local prerogatives. He once refused to accept the appointment of the pope’s nephewto a living in his diocese, saying, “As an obedient son, I disobey, I contradict, I rebel…my every word and act is not rebellion, but filial honor due by God’s blessed command to father and mother.” "

Identifying Andrew as Peter’s brother makes it easy to know who he is, but it also makes it easy to overlook the fact of Andrew’s own special gift to the company of Christ. The Gospel according to John tells how Andrew, a disciple of John the Baptist, was one of two disciples who followed Jesus after John had pointed him out, saying, “Behold the Lamb of God” (John 1:29). Andrew and the other disciple went with Jesus and stayed with him, and Andrew’s first act afterward was to find his brother and bring him to Jesus. We might call Andrew the first missionary in the company of disciples. ",

Andrew was also the disciple who brought the boy with the loaves and fishes to Jesus for the feeding of the multitude. ",

Eusebius, the early church historian, records his going to Scythia, but there is no reliable information about the end of his life.

Whatever his relationship to Jesus—brother, half-brother, or cousin—James was converted after the resurrection. Eventually, he became Bishop of Jerusalem.",
        "In the first letter to the Corinthians (15:7), Paul says that James was favored with a special appearance of the Lord before the ascension. Later, James dealt cordially with Paul at Jerusalem, when the latter came there to meet Peter and the other apostles. During the Council of Jerusalem, when there was disagreement about whether Gentile converts should be circumcised, James summed up the momentous decision with these words: “My judgment is that we should impose no irksome restrictions on those Gentiles who are turning to God” (Acts 15:19).",
        "Eusebius, quoting from an earlier church history by Hegesippus, declares that James was surnamed “the Just.” He was holy, abstemious, did not cut his hair nor oil his body, and was continually on his knees in prayer, interceding for his people. “As many as came to believe did so through James,” says Hegesippus.

Clearly, Matthew was hardly the type of man that a devout Jew would have had among his closest associates.

Although an unabashedly fictionalized account, it is nevertheless an inspiring tale that shows Matthias being dealt the worst possible lot, and yet nevertheless responding to his call with equanimity, competence, and grace, which are the same qualities we see reflected in the canonical account that is given by Scripture."

When Jesus insisted on going to Judea,to visit his friends at Bethany, Thomas boldly declared, “Let us also go, that we may die with him” (John 11:16). At the Last Supper, he interrupted our Lord’s discourse with the question, “Lord, we do not know where you are going; how can we know the way?” (John 14:5). And after Christ’s resurrection, Thomas would not accept the account of the women and the other apostles, until Jesus himself appeared beforehim, showing him his wounds. This drew from him the first explicit acknowledgment of Christ’s divinity, “My Lord and my God!” (John 20:28). ",
        "Thomas appears to have been a thoughtful if perhaps literal-minded man, inclined to skepticism; but he was a staunch friend when his loyalty was once given. The expression “Doubting Thomas,” which has become established in English usage, is not entirely fair to Thomas. He did not refuse belief: he wanted to believe, but did not dare, without further evidence. Because of his goodwill, Jesus gave him a sign, although Jesus had refused a sign to the Pharisees. His Lord’s rebuke was well deserved: “Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe” (John 20:29). The sign did not create faith; it merely released the faith that was in Thomas already. ",

In 1854, Schereschewsky immigrated to America and entered the Western Theological Seminary in Pittsburgh to train for the ministry of the Presbyterian Church. After two years, he decided to become an Episcopalian and to finish his theological studies at the General Theological Seminary in New York City, from which he graduated in 1859. ",

With heroic perseverance, Schereschewsky completed his translation of the Bible, typing some 2,000 pages with the middle finger of his partially crippled hand. Four years before his death, he said, “I have sat in this chair for over twenty years. It seemed very hard at first. But God knew best.

        "The sayings relate that Amma Sarah lived beside a beautiful river for sixty years, yet never lifted her eyes in distraction from prayer to look at it. She often said, “If I prayed to God that all people should approve of my conduct, I should find myself a penitent at the door of each one, but I shall rather pray that my heart may be pure towards all.”  Many people came to visit her seeking spiritual advice. On one occasion some monks came to her claiming to be from the highly regarded community of Scetis and she offered them a basket of fruit from which they took the rotten fruit and left the good fruit for others to eat. She then said to them, “You are true monks of Scetis.” At another time, some elderly monks, considered to be great anchorites, came to see her hoping to humiliate her and shame her. They came to her and said, “Be careful not to become conceited because we great anchorites are coming to see you, a mere woman!” Amma Sarah only replied, “According to nature I am a woman, but not according to my thoughts. It is I who am a man and you who are women.”  ",
        "Amma Theodora was the wife of a Roman tribune, but after his death she retired to the desert to live an ascetic life.  She was consulted by many people for her wisdom on prayer.  According to one of her teachings, those who set their minds to pray are often overcome with distraction, depression, faintheartedness, or headaches.  But she relates the story of how a certain monk, every time he felt too ill to pray, declared: “Clearly I am very near death, and so I should get up and pray right now before I die!”  In this way, he resisted temptation.  Yet Amma Theodora also stressed that temptations can only be overcome through humility rather than through asceticism, for even the demons fast and keep vigil and live in deserted places, but they do not have humility.",
        "Amma Syncletica lived a life of asceticism in a tomb in Alexandria.  She wrote, “if you find yourself in a place, do not forsake it to go to another place, for that will harm you a great deal.  Just as a bird who abandons the eggs that she was sitting on prevents them from hatching, so too a monastic grows cold and her faith dies when she wanders from one place to another.”  She also taught that it was possible to live a spiritual life within secular society, not only as a monk or a nun.  “There are many who live in the desert yet behave as though they were in town, and they are wasting their time.  It is possible to be a monastic in one’s mind while living in a crowd, and it is also possible for a monastic to live in a crowd amidst her own thoughts.”"

Plumbariola was convenient to her brother’s monastery at Monte Cassino, and Benedict regularly visited his sister to discuss the scriptures and spiritual matters.  ",
        "On one such visit, late in her life, Scholastica—perhaps knowing that her time was short—begged her brother to remain overnight.  Benedict refused, as this would violate his own monastic rule. Scholastica then prayed for God’s intervention, and the weather, which was already threatening, turned violent, so that Benedict was trapped.

        "Sergius’ firm support of Prince Dimitri Donskoi helped to rally the Russians against their Tartar overlords. Dimitri won a decisive victory against them at the Kulikovo Plains in 1380 and laid the foundation of his people’s independent national life.",
        "Sergius was simple and gentle in nature, mystical in temperament, and eager to ensure that his monks should serve the needs of their neighbors. He was able to inspire intense devotion to the Orthodox faith. He died in 1392, and pilgrims still visit his shrine at the monastery of Sergiyev Posad, which he founded in 1340. The city, located some forty-three miles northwest of Moscow, contains several splendid cathedrals and is the residence of the Patriarch of Moscow.",
        "The Russian Church observes Sergius’ memory on September 25th. His name is familiar to Anglicans from the Fellowship of St. Alban and St. Sergius, a society established to promote closer relations between the Anglican and Orthodox Churches."

(Acts 9:36) The Scriptures mention that many widows had benefitted from her work in making them clothes. Their desire to show Peter examples was both a testament to her charity and perhaps also the level of craftsmanship with which she made them.",

This story is likely intended to recall the story of Jesus healing the young girl in Luke 8:41–56 when Jesus performed a similar miracle. This miracle of life performed for Tabitha through Peter caused many in the town to believe in Jesus. It, like many miracles recorded in Acts, was a confirmation that the message was true and that the apostles did indeed speak for God. ",
        "She is also mentioned by Basil of Caesarea as an example of charity and good works, and as a role model for other widows: “A widow who enjoys sufficiently robust health should spend her life in works of zeal and solicitude, keeping in mind the words of the Apostle and the example of Dorcas.”"

        "Teresa was born in Spain, near Avila. Even in her childhood, she took much pleasure in the study of saints’ lives, and she used to delight in spending times of contemplation, repeating over and over, “For ever, for ever, for ever, for ever, they shall see God.” ",
        "In her autobiography, Teresa tells that following her mother’s death, she became quite worldly. To offset this, her father placed her in an Augustinian convent to be educated, but serious illness ended her studies. During convalescence, she determined to enter the religious life and, though opposed by her father, she became a postulant at a Carmelite convent. Again, illness forced her to return home, but after three years, she returned to the convent.  ",
        "Her prayer life during this period was difficult.  She wrote: “I don’t know what heavy penance could have come to mind that I would not have gladly and frequently undertaken rather than recollect myself in the practice of prayer.”  This early difficult experience would shape her later writings on prayer, in which she insisted that the spiritual life cannot be grounded in feelings and consolations.  ",
        "In time, frustrated by the laxity of life in her community, Teresa set out to establish a reformed Carmelite order of “discalced” religious, who wore sandals or went barefoot. Despite many setbacks, she traveled for 25 years throughout Spain. Energetic, practical, and efficient, as well as being a mystic and ascetic, she established 17 convents of Reformed Carmelites. Even imprisonment did not deter her.   Her younger contemporary John of the Cross became a close personal and spiritual friend.",
        "Her sisters urged her to write down some of her teachings on prayer for them, which is how we came to have her works The Interior Castle and The Way of Perfection. Many people at the time felt that mental prayer (as opposed to reciting the vocal prayer of the liturgy) was too difficult and too dangerous for women, but Teresa insisted that “Mental prayer is nothing else than an intimate sharing between friends.  It means taking time frequently to be alone with him whom we know loves us.” ",
        "Despite the demands of her administrative and missionary work, Teresa found time to write the numerous letters that give us rare insights into her personality and concerns. Her extensive correspondence often kept her awake at night until 3:00 in the morning, after which she would awaken at 5:00 for morning prayer with the community.  Teresa found writing to be burdensome, and often protested that she would be much happier spinning or working in the kitchen.  Once she sat down to write, however, she was eloquent and efficient.  Her great work The Interior Castle was written in less than two months. ",
        "Her death in 1582, following two years of illness, was peaceful. Her last sight was of the Sacrament, brought for her comfort; her last words, “O my Lord! Now is the time that we may see each other.” "

        "Today’s feast commemorates how God made known to a young Jewish woman that she was to be the mother of his Son.  The Annunciation has been a major theme in Christian art, in both East and West, and innumerable sermons and poems have been composed about it. The term coined by Cyril of Alexandria for the Blessed Virgin, Theotokos (“the God-bearer”), was affirmed by the General Council of Ephesus in 431. ",
        "Many theologians stress that Mary accepted her vocation with perfect conformity of will. Mary’s self-offering in response to God’s call has been compared to that of Abraham, the father of believers. Just as Abraham was called to be the father of the chosen people, and accepted his call, so Mary was called to be the mother of the faithful, the new Israel. She is God’s human agent in the mystery of the Incarnation. Her response to the angel, “Let it be to me according to your word,” is identical with the faith expressed in the prayer that Jesus taught: “Your will be done on earth as in heaven.” ",
        "But while many Christians emphasize the submissiveness of Mary, according to the sixth-century Syriac writer Jacob of Sarug, the most important words that Mary spoke were not those of quiet acquiescence but rather, \"How can this be?\" Indeed, in Jacob's account of the gospel encounter, Mary's response is much more than a single question. Instead, a teenage girl takes on an archangel in a theological debate and freely consents only when she has been convinced that the angel's word is true.  In this interpretation, it is Mary's eagerness to understand God’s plan and her own role in it that makes her exemplary rather than her meek consent. Jacob contrasts her behavior with Eve, who did not question the serpent that tempted her in the garden but uncritically accepted the claim that she and Adam would become like gods without testing it first. In Eve's case, \"lack of doubt gave birth to death\" because she simply believed whatever she was told and \"was won over without any debate.\"  ",
        "In both of these interpretation, however, our salvation is only possible because of Mary’s free cooperation with God in that salvation.  It has been said, “God made us without us, and redeemed us without us, but cannot save us without us.” Mary’s assent to God’s call opened the way for God to accomplish the salvation of the world. It is for this reason that all generations have called her “blessed.”"

Because of jealousy and envy the greatest and most upright pillars of the church were persecuted and competed unto death. Let us bring before our eyes the good apostles—Peter, who because of unrighteous jealousy endured not one or two, but numerous trials, and so bore a martyr’s witness and went to the glorious place that he deserved. Because of jealousy and strife Paul pointed the way to the reward of endurance; seven times he was imprisoned, he was exiled, he was stoned, he was a preacher in both East and West, and won renown for his faith, teaching uprightness to the whole world, and reaching the farthest limit of the West, and bearing a martyr’s witness before the rulers, he passed out of the world and was taken up into the holy place, having proved a very great example of endurance.” "

Philip, in turn, found his friend Nathanael, and convinced him to come and see Jesus, the Messiah. Later, when Jesus saw the hungry crowd, he asked Philip, “How are we to buy bread, so that these people may eat?” (John 6:5). Philip’s practical response, “Two hundred denarii would not buy enough bread for each of them to get a little” (John 6:7), was the prelude to the feeding of the multitude with the loaves and fishes. In a later incident in John’s Gospel, some Greeks came to Philip asking to see Jesus. At the Last Supper, Philip’s request, “Lord, show us the Father, and we shall be satisfied,” evokes the response, “Have I been with you so long, and yet you do not know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father” (John 14:8,9). "

Two Sundays in Advent focus on that preaching and the First Sunday after the Epiphany celebrates Jesus’ baptism by John as a central moment where the fullness of Christ’s humanity and divinity are revealed.  In Mark’s Gospel, John’s arrest is the moment when Jesus begins his public ministry.  John’s death likewise has a profound impact the narrative in the Gospels.   ",

The Gospel recounts the sordid tale of a young woman’s manipulation and the foolish promise that Herod makes.  Caught by his own rash promise and pride, Herod has the man he fears put to death and his head delivered on a platter to the girl, who takes it to her mother, Herodias.   The gruesome narrative ends, as John’s disciples take his body and bury it and then go to Jesus to tell him what has happened.  ",

No doubt the unjust execution of a fierce and admired prophet left many in fear, anger, and confusion.   That day’s teaching led to the Feeding of the Five Thousand and soon thereafter to the Transfiguration, Peter’s Confession, and the First Prediction of the Passion.

Opposed at first to the baptism of Gentiles, he had the humility to admit a change of heart, and to baptize the Roman centurion Cornelius and his household. Even after this, Peter had a continuing struggle with his conservatism, for Paul, writing to the Galatians, rebukes him for giving way to the demands of Jewish Christians to dissociate himself from table-fellowship with Gentiles.

According to a legend based on that tradition, Peter fled from Rome during the persecution under Nero. On the Appian Way, he met Christ, and asked him, “Domine, quo vadis?” (“Lord, where are you going?”). Jesus answered, “I am coming to be crucified again.” Peter thereupon retraced his steps, and was shortly thereafter crucified, head downwards. “I am not worthy to be crucified as my Lord was,” he is supposed to have said.

I had long read about martyrdom in the lives of the saints—how the souls of the martyrs had gone home to Heaven, how they had been filled with glory in Paradise, how the angels had blown trumpets. This was the splendid martyrdom I had often seen in my dreams. But the martyrdom of the Japanese Christians I now describe to you was no such glorious thing. What a miserable and painful business it was! The rain falls unceasingly on the sea. And the sea which killed them surges on uncannily—in silence.” ",
        "By 1630, what was left of Christianity in Japan was driven underground. Yet it is remarkable that two hundred and fifty years later there were found many men and women, without priests or sacraments, who had preserved through the generations a vestige of Christian faith. "

        "In August 1878, yellow fever invaded the city of Memphis, Tennessee for the third time in ten years. By the month’s end, the disease had become epidemic and a quarantine was ordered. While more than 25,000 citizens had fled in terror, nearly 20,000 more remained to face the pestilence. As cases multiplied, the death toll averaged 200 people per day. When the worst was over, ninety percent of the people who remained had contracted the fever and more than 5,000 people had died. ",
        "In that time of panic and flight, many brave men and women, both lay and ordained, remained at their posts of duty or came as volunteersto assist in spite of the terrible risk. Notable among these heroes were four Episcopal sisters from the Community of Saint Mary, and two of their clergy colleagues, all of whom died while tending to the sick.  They have ever since been known as “The Martyrs of Memphis,” as have those of other communions who ministered in Christ’s name during this time of desolation. ",

Harris, the cathedral dean, and Sister Constance immediately organized relief work among the stricken. Helping were six of Constance’s fellow Sisters of St. Mary, plus Sister Clare from St. Margaret’s House, Boston, Massachusetts; the Reverend Charles C. Parsons, Rector of Grace and St. Lazarus Church, Memphis; and the Reverend Louis S. Schuyler, assistant at Holy Innocents, Hoboken, New Jersey. The cathedral group also included three physicians, two of whom were ordained Episcopal priests, the Sisters’ two matrons, and several volunteer nurses from New York. ",
        "The cathedral buildings were located in the most infected region of Memphis. Here, amid sweltering heat and scenes of indescribable horror, these men and women of God gave relief to the sick, comfort to the dying, and homes to the many orphaned children. Only two of the workers escaped the fever. Among those who died were Sisters Constance, Thecla, Ruth, and Frances from the Community of Saint Mary, the Reverend Charles Parsons, and the Reverend Louis Schuyler. All six are buried at Elmwood Cemetery. The monument marking the joint grave of Fathers Parsons and Schuyler bears the inscription: “Greater Love Hath No Man.” The high altar in St. Mary’s Cathedral, Memphis, is a memorial to the four Sisters.

One historian reckons that the total number of martyrs from all Christian denominations during this period was around330.

Once the invasion occurred, however, they realized that their presence was a danger to the local people with whom they stayed; any people of European descent were considered enemy combatants and villages harboring them were severely punished. Two of the missionaries, one Australian and one Papuan, were evacuating with the villagers when their boat was strafed and sunk by sea-planes. The remaining missionaries were captured in the bush. Some were executed by soldiers, and others by locals who feared retribution for their presence. ",

        "These martyrdoms greatly changed the dynamic of Christian growth in Uganda. Introduced by a handful of Anglican and Roman Catholic missionaries after 1877, the Christian faith had been preached only to the immediate members of the court, by order of King Mutesa. His successor, Mwanga, became increasingly angry as he realized that the first converts put loyalty to Christ above the traditional loyalty to the king. ",
        "The martyrdoms began in 1885.  Mwanga first forbade anyone to go near a Christian mission on pain of death, but when he found himself unable to cool the ardor of the converts, he resolved to wipe out Christianity. ",
        "The Namugongo martyrdoms produced a result entirely opposite to Mwanga’s intentions. The example of these martyrs, who walked to their death singing hymns and praying for their enemies, so inspired many of the bystanders that they began to seek instruction from the remaining Christians. Within a few years the original handfulof converts had multiplied many times and had spread far beyond the court. The martyrs had left the indelible impression that Christianity was truly African, not simply a white man’s religion. Most of the missionary work was carried out by Africans rather than by white missionaries, and Christianity spread steadily. ",

        "That Jesus was born is a fact both of history and revelation. The precise date of his birth, however, is not recorded in the Gospels, which are, after all, not biographies, and show little concern for those biographical details in which more modern Christians are interested. Such interest began to become prominent in the fourth century, together with the development of liturgical observances concerning the events of biblical history. ",
        "Scholars have offered various theories about how December 25th came to be selected as the date for the liturgical commemoration of the Nativity in the Western Church. An older scholarly view suggests that the date, coming as it doesat the winter solstice, was already a sacred one, being observed by Roman pagans as the festival of the birth of the Unconquerable Sun (dies natalis Solis Invicti).  This correspondence is noted by some early Christian writers themselves, who see it as a fitting parallel, but the pagan celebration was only established in the late third century, and the Christian observance of December 25th seems to have even earlier antecedents. ",
        "An alternative explanation calculates the date of Christmas based on the date of Passover and Easter.  Many early Christian theologians, particularly in North Africa, calculated that the Crucifixion had taken place on the 14th of Nisan, which worked out to be March 25th on the Roman calendar.  This date also became celebrated as the Feast of the Annunciation because of a widespread pious belief that Jesus died on the same date that he was conceived, showing how deeply interconnected all of the events of salvation history were. December 25th, then, becomes the date of Christ’s birth, because it is exactly nine months after the date of his conception. This method of calculating also explains the traditional dating in the Eastern church, which historically fixed the Nativity on January 6th rather than December 25th. The Eastern church calculated the date of both Annunciation and Crucifixion using not the 14th of Nisan, but rather the 14th of Artemisios, the first spring month on the Greek calendar. This translates to April 6th on the Roman calendar, which is nine months before January 6th. ",
        "The full title of the feast dates from the 1662 edition of the Book of Common Prayer. Prior to that revision, the day was known only as “Christmas Day.” The word “Christmas,” which can be traced to the twelfth century, is a contraction of “Christ’s Mass.” "

        "The Transfiguration is not to be understood only as a spiritual experience of Jesus while at prayer, which three chosen disciples, Peter, James, and John, were permitted to witness. It is one of a series of spiritual manifestations by which God authenticated Jesus as his Son. It is at one with the appearance of the angels at the birth and at his resurrection, and with the descent of the Spirit at Jesus’ baptism. Matthew records the voice from heaven saying, “This ismy Son, the Beloved, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him” (Matthew 17:5). Briefly the veil is drawn aside, and a chosen feware permitted to see Jesus, not only as the human son of Mary, but also as the eternal Son of God. Moses and Elijah witness to Jesus as the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets. In Luke’s account of the event, they speak of the “exodus” which Jesus is to accomplish at Jerusalem. A cloud, a sign of divine presence, envelops the disciples, and a heavenly voice proclaims Jesus to be the Son of God. ",

And, being found in human form, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross” (Philippians 2:6–8). ",

Although in theory that conflict had been settled in favor of the veneration of icons at the Seventh Ecumenical Council in 787, in practice disagreements remained strong, and the iconoclastic party included many prominent members of society, including within the imperial family. ",
        "A young noblewoman of Armenian descent, Theodora was married to the young emperor Theophilos in the year 830.  Although both were sincere Christians, the couple had strong disagreements about religious matters.  Theophilos was an iconoclast and believed that the veneration of icons was idolatry.  Theodora, however, maintained her own practice of venerating images in spite of her husband’s opposition.  On one occasion, when a servant reported to Theophilos that his wife had been seen venerating icons, she sweetly informed him that she had merely been “playing with dolls.” Two of her icons are kept in a monastery on Mount Athos to this day, where they are referred to as “Theodora’s dolls.”",
        "In spite of this theological conflict, the couple seem to have had a largely happy marriage, and had five daughters and two sons.  Theophilos, however, died very young at the age of 29, and Theodora’s life changed considerably.  Her young son Michael was only a toddler and was too young to assume leadership, and so she ruled the Byzantine emperor as his regent from 842 until 855.",
        "One of Theodora’s first acts as regent was summon a synod of bishops to revisit the question of icons and iconoclasm.  The practice of icon veneration was restored, and the synod ended in a procession that carried icons back into the Hagia Sophia.",
        "Despite this victory, however, Theodora was noted for the particular gentleness with which she treated her theological opponents.  She negotiated strongly with the church to ensure that her late husband would not be condemned as a heretic, and pursued a moderate policy of accommodation with clergy who had been iconoclasts.  This was strongly opposed by more extreme factions within the church who wanted to see them denounced and punished as heretics, but Theodora remained firm in her attitude of respect for those who had held differing opinions.  This ultimately led most of the iconoclastic party to gradually accept the majority view and to remain within the church.   ",
        "Theodora is therefore remembered not only for her role in restoring the veneration of icons to the church, but for her firm and diplomatic insistence upon reconciliation with those who had held opposing views, which made this one theological controversy that ended in reconciliation rather than in schism.",

He presided over synods that brought about reforms, according to established rules of canon law. He also laid the foundations of the parochial organization that still persists in the English church.",

        "Called “the greatest saint in modern times” by Pope Pius X, canonized by Pope Pius XI just twenty-eight years after her death, and named a Doctor of the Church by Pope John Paul II, Thérèse of Lisieux has become one of the most beloved saints of the Roman Catholic Church.",
        "From an early age, Thérèse felt called to the religious life; even as a little girl she played at being a nun. On Christmas Even 1886, at age fourteen, she experienced a vision of the infant Christ and what she called a “complete conversion.” Thereafter she understood her vocation to be prayer for priests, and she began seeking admittance to the Carmelite convent in Lisieux. When she entered the order at age 17 as a Discalced Carmelite, she assumed the name Thérèse of the Child Jesus and the Holy Face. ",
        "Dedicated to what she called her “little way,” she led a simple, quiet life of prayer — in particular for priests — and small acts of charity. She struggled with illness throughout her life and suffered greatly from tuberculosis before her death in 1897 at age twenty-four. At age twenty-two, just two years before her death, her prioress instructed her to write her memoirs. The Story of a Soul, as it came to be called, commended a life “great love” rather than “great deeds,” echoing the insight of The Imitation of Christ by Thomas à Kempis, a book that had helped her to discover her vocation and develop her spiritual life. She corresponded with Roman Catholic missionaries to China and Indonesia as well as with young priests, pursing what she saw as the mission of the Carmelites, “to form evangelical workers who will save thousands of souls whose mothers we shall be.” ",
        "Towards the end of her short life, Thérèse experienced a profound sense of abandonment by God, but even this did not shake her love for God.  On the verge of death, Thérèse confessed that she had “lost her faith” and all her certainty, and was now “only capable of loving”.  She experienced her sense of separation from God as something to be born in solidarity with unbelievers.  She “no longer saw” God in the light of faith, but nevertheless responded to him with a passionate love.  In this experience, her youthful decision that her vocation was “to be love in the heart of the church” lost all hint of sentimentality.  Her last words epitomize her “little way”: “My God, I love you.”"

        "Thomas à Kempis is one of the best known and most beloved medieval Christian spiritual writers. Millions of Christians have found his work The Imitation of Christ to be a treasured and constant source of edification, and it has been translated into an astonishingly wide range of languages.",
        "Thomas Hammerken was born at Kempen in the Duchy of Cleves about 1380. He was educated at Deventer by the Brethren of the Common Life, and joined their order in 1399 at their house of Mount St. Agnes in Zwolle (in the Low Countries). ",
        "The Order of the Brethren of the Common Life was founded by Gerard Groote (1340–1384) at Deventer. It included both clergy and lay members who cultivated a biblical piety of a practical rather than speculative nature, with stress upon the inner life and the practiceof virtues. They supported themselves by copying manuscripts and teaching. Many have seen in them harbingers of the Reformation; but the Brethren had little interest in the problems of the institutional church. Their spirituality, known as the “New Devotion” (Devotio moderna), has influenced both Catholic and Protestant traditions of prayer and meditation. ",
        "In The Imitation of Christ, Thomas wrote: “A humble knowledge of oneself is a surer road to God than a deep searching of the sciences. Yet learning itself is not to be blamed, nor is the simple knowledge of anything whatsoever to be despised, for true learning is good in itself and ordained by God; but a good conscience and a holy life are always to be preferred. But because many are more eager to acquire much learning than to live well, they often go astray, and bear little or no fruit. If only such people were as diligent in the uprooting of vices and the panting of virtues as they are in the debating of problems, there would not be so many evils and scandals among the people, nor such laxity in communities. At the Day of Judgement, we shall not be asked what we have read, but what we have done; not how eloquently we have spoken, but how holily we have lived. Tell me, where are now all those Masters and Doctors whom you knew so well in their lifetime in the full flower of their learning? Other men now sit in their seats, and they are hardly ever called to mind. In their lifetime they seemed of great account, but now no one speaks of them.”",

        "Thomas Aquinas is one of the most influential theologians in the history of Western Christianity. Born into a noble Italian family, probably in 1225, he entered the new Dominican Order of Preachers as a young man, and soon became an outstanding teacher in an age of intellectual ferment. ",
        "Perceiving the challenges that the recent rediscovery of Aristotle’s works might entail for traditional Christian doctrine, especially in their emphasis upon empirical knowledge derived from reason and sense perception independent of faith and revelation, Thomas asserted that reason and revelation are in basic harmony. “Grace”, he said, “is not the denial of nature, but the perfection of it.” This synthesis Thomas accomplished in his greatest works, the Summa Theologiae and the Summa Contra Gentiles, which even today continue to exercise profound influence on Christian thought and philosophy. Although his theology is now considered to be conventional by many Christians, especially among Roman Catholics, in his own day Thomas was considered a bold thinker, even a “radical,” and certain aspects of his thought were condemned by the ecclesiastical authorities. His canonization on July 18th, 1323 vindicated him. ",
        "Thomas understood God’s disclosure of his Name, in Exodus 3:14, “I Am Who I Am,” to mean that God is Being, the Ultimate Reality from which everything else derives its being. The difference between God and the world is that God’s essence is to exist, whereas all other beings derive their being from him by the act of creation. Although God and the world are distinct, there is, nevertheless, an analogy of being between God and the world, since the Creator is reflected in his creation. It is therefore possible to have a limited knowledge of God by analogy from the created world. On this basis, human reason can demonstrate that God exists; that he created the world; and that he contains in himself, as their cause, all the perfections that exist in his creation. The distinctive truths of Christian faith, however, such as the Trinity and the Incarnation, are known only by revelation. ",
        "In December 1273, after decades of churning out theological writings at an astonishing pace, Thomas suddenly stopped, leaving his great Summa unfinished.  When pressed as to why, he could only say that he had experienced a mystical encounter so profound that all of his former words seemed empty to him now.  “All that I have written seems to me like so much straw compared to what I have seen and what has been revealed to me!” ",
        "Thomas died in 1274, just under fifty years of age. In 1369, on January 28th, his remains were transferred to Toulouse. In addition to his many theological writings, he composed several eucharistic hymns. They include “O saving Victim” (The Hymnal 1982, #310; #311) and “Now, my tongue, the mystery telling” (The Hymnal 1982, #329; #330; #331)."

Later, he was sent tostudy law in Italy and France and, after being ordained as a deacon, he was appointed as Archdeacon of Canterbury. His administrative skills eventually brought him to the notice of King Henry II, who, to Thomas’s surprise, appointed him as the Chancellor of England.",
        "He and the King became intimate friends, and because of Becket’s unquestioning loyalty and support of the King’s interests in both church and state, Henry secured Thomas’s election as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1162. Becket, foreseeing a break with his Royal Master, was reluctant to accept. As Archbishop he changed, as he tells us, “from a patron of play actors and a follower of hounds, to being a shepherd of souls.” He also defended the interests of the church against those of his former friend and patron, the King. The struggle between the two became so bitter that Thomas sought exile at an abbey in France. ",
        "When he returned to England six years later, the fragile reconciliation between Henry and the Archbishop broke down. In a fit of rage, the King is alleged to have asked his courtiers, “Who will rid me of this meddlesome priest?” Four barons, taking Henry’s words as an order, made their way to Canterbury, and, upon finding the archbishop in the cathedral on December 29th, 1170, struck him down with their swords. Later, when the monks of Canterbury undressed Thomas’s body to wash it and prepare it for burial, they discovered that under his episcopal robes their worldly and determined archbishop was wearing a hair shirt. While such a garment hardly proves that a person is a saint, it clearly indicates that Thomas was motivated in the exercise of his office by far more than political considerations. His final words to the four barons before receiving the fatal blow were, “Willingly I die for the name of Jesus and in the defense of the church.” "

In 1696 he was invited by the Bishop of London to be responsible for the oversight of churchwork in the colony of Maryland. Three years later, as the Bishop’s Commissary, he sailed to the American colonies for his first, and only, visitation. ",
        "Though he spent only two and a half months in Maryland, Bray was deeply concerned about the neglected state of the American churches, and the great need for the education of clergy, laity, and children. At a general visitation of the clergy at Annapolis, before his return to England, he emphasized the need for the instruction of children, and insisted that no clergyman be given a charge unless he had a good report from the ship in which he crossed the Atlantic, “whether…he gave no matter of scandal, and whether he did constantly read prayers twice a day and catechize and preach on Sundays, which, notwithstanding the common excuses, I know can be done by a minister of any zeal for religion.” His understanding of, and concern for, Native Americans and African Americans were far ahead of his time. He founded thirty-nine lending libraries in America, as well as numerous schools. He raised money for missionary work and influenced young English priests to go to America. ",
        "Bray tried hard to have a bishop consecrated for the American colonies, but failed. His greatest contributions were the founding of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge and the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, both of which are still effectively in operation after two and a half centuries of work all over the world. ",
        "From 1706 to 1730, Bray was the rector of St. Botolph Without Aldgate in London, where, until his death there on February 15th, 1730, at the age of 72, he served with energy and devotion, while continuing his efforts on behalf of black slaves in America, and in the founding of parochial libraries. ",
        "When the deplorable condition of English prisons was brought to Bray’s attention, he set to work to influence public opinion andto raise funds to alleviate the misery of the inmates. He organized Sunday “Beef and Beer” dinners in prisons, and advanced proposals for prison reform. It was Thomas Bray who first suggested to General Oglethorpe the idea of founding a humanitarian colony for the relief of honest debtors, but he died before the Georgia colony became a reality. "

        "Ministry to the deaf in the Episcopal Church begins with Thomas Gallaudet and his protégé, Henry Winter Syle. Without Gallaudet’s genius and zeal for the spiritual well-being of deaf persons, it is improbable that a history of ministry to the deaf in the Episcopal Church could be written. He has been called “The Apostle to the Deaf.” ",
        "Gallaudet was born June 3rd, 1822, in Hartford.  He was the eldest son of Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, founder of the West Hartford School for the Deaf, and his wife, Sophia, who was deaf. ",
        "After graduating from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, Thomas announced his desire to becomea priest in the Episcopal Church. His father, who was a Congregationalist minister, prevailed upon him to postpone a final decision, and to accept a teaching position in the New York Institution for Deaf-Mutes. There he met and married a deaf woman named Elizabeth Budd. ",
        "Gallaudet was ordained as a deacon in 1850 and served his diaconate at St. Stephen’s Church, where he established a Bible class for deaf persons.  Ordained as a priest in 1851, Gallaudet became Assistant Rector atSt. Ann’s Church, where he conceived a plan for establishing a church that would be a spiritual home for deaf people. This became a reality the following year, with the founding of St. Ann’s Church for Deaf-Mutes. The congregation was able to purchase a church building in 1859, and it became a center for missionary work to the deaf continuing into its merger with the parish of Calvary-St. George in 1976. As a result of this ministry, mission congregations were established in many cities. Gallaudet died on August 27th, 1902. ",
        "One fruit of Gallaudet’s ministry was Henry Winter Syle.  Born in China, he had lost his hearing as a young child as the result of scarlet fever. Educated at Trinity College, Hartford; St. John’s College, Cambridge, England; and Yale University, Syle was a brilliant student, who persisted in his determination to obtain an education in spite of his deafness and fragile health. He was encouraged by Gallaudet to offer himself for ordination as a priest, and was supported in that call by Bishop William Bacon Stevens of Pennsylvania, against the opposition of many who believed that the impairment of one of the senses was an impediment to ordination. Syle was ordained as a deacon in 1876, the first deaf person to be ordained in this church, and later ordained as a priest in 1883.  In 1888, he built All Souls Church for the Deaf in Philadelphia, the first Episcopal church constructed especially for deaf persons. He died on January 6th, 1890. "

His close relationship with the royal family began when he became chaplain to Princess Mary of Orange at The Hague. Ken was appalled at the Prince of Orange’s treatment of his wife, and rebuked him publicly.",
        "In 1683, Ken returned to England and became chaplain to Charles II. His integrity stirred him to rebuke Charles for lax behavior. When Ken was notified that the King’s mistress, the actress Nell Gwynne, was to be lodged at his house, he refused, saying, “a woman of ill-repute ought not to be endured in the house of a clergyman, and especially the King’s chaplain.” The King took no offense, but in the next year made Ken the Bishop of Bath and Wells, declaring that none should have the position except “the little … fellow that refused his lodging to poor Nelly.”",
        "In 1688, when Charles’ successor, James II, tried to undermine the authority of the Church of England and restore Roman Catholicism, Ken was one of seven bishops who refused to read the King’s Declaration of Indulgence, which offered toleration to Protestant non-conformists and to Roman Catholics. The seven bishops were sent to the Tower, but were acquitted in the courts, and became popular heroes. After the Revolution of 1688, however, Ken’s conscience did not permit him to swear allegiance to William of Orange, who became King William III. As a Non-Juror, Ken was deprived of his see.",
        "Ken’s conscience would not let him rest and his disagreement with others of the “Non-Juring” party over various matters troubled him for the rest of his life. He deplored the Non-Juror schism, and after the accession of Queen Anne in 1702, he made his peace with the Church of England, encouraging his fellow Non-Jurors to return to their parish churches in 1710. Ken announced his intention to do the same, but died on March 19th, 1711 before doing so.",
        "A man of deep piety, Ken was the author of several religious works, which were immensely popular in the eighteenth century. He is best known as a writer of hymns, particularly the well-known evening hymn, “All praise to thee, my God, this night” (The Hymnal 1982, #43), which concludes with his doxology, “Praise God from whom all blessings flow.”  One of the most compelling products of his piety and his pen is the prayer, “Our God, amidst the deplorable division of your church, let us never widen its breaches, but give us universal charity to all who are called by your name. Deliver us from the sins and errors, the schisms and heresies of the age. Give us grace daily to pray for the peace of your church, and earnestly to seek it and to excite all we can to praise and love you; through Jesus Christ, our one Savior and Redeemer.”"

Even as a child, he loved religion, and by age thirteen he began his seminary training, where his classmates nicknamed him “Patriarch.” At 23, he graduated as a layman and began to teach moral theology. Three years later, he became a monk and was given the name Tikhon. ",

Tikhon was held in such esteem that the United States made him an honorary citizen. While living there, he established many new cathedrals and churches, and participated in ecumenical events with other denominations, in particular the Episcopal Church. In 1900, at the consecration of Bishop Reginald Weller as coadjutor of the Diocese of Fond du Lac, the diocesan bishop, Charles Grafton, invited Tikhon to sit on his own throne. The Archbishop would have participated in the laying-on-of-hands if the Episcopal Church’s House of Bishops had not forbidden it. Tikhon later established warm relations with the Diocese of California. ",

When a severe famine caused many peasants to starve in 1921, the Patriarch ordered the sale of many church treasures to purchase food for the hungry. Soon the government began seizing church property for itself, and many believers were killedin defense of their faith. The Communists tried to wrest control ofthe church from Tikhon, while he, in turn, attempted to shelter his people. To this end, he discouraged the clergy from making political statements that might antagonize the government. He prayed, “May God teach every one of us to strive for His truth, and for the good of the Holy Church, rather than something for our sake.” ",

A skilled organizer, he helped found trade unions and credit unions among dock workers, factory laborers, and subsistence farmers. Trade unions were forbidden at the time, and Kagawa was twice imprisoned. He was also a pacifist and organized the National Anti-War League in 1928. Kagawa was arrested in 1940 for publicly apologizing to the people of China for Japan’s invasion of that country. An advocate for universal male suffrage (granted in 1925), he later became a voice for women’s right to vote as well. ",
        "A prolific author, his autobiographical novel, Crossing the Death Line (1920) became a best seller, and many of his other novels and writings in a Christian Socialist vein were translated into English. He used the revenues from his substantial book sales to fund his extensive slum work. Although Kagawa was under police surveillance much of his life, the Japanese government called on him to organize the rebuilding of Tokyo after a 1923 earthquake and again at the end of World War II to serve as head of the country’s social welfare programs. ",
        "Although some knew him best as a social reformer and pacifist, Kagawa saw himself first of all an evangelist. “Christ alone can make all things new,” he said. “The spirit of Christ must be the soul of all real social reconstruction.” ",
        "Kagawa died on April 23rd, 1960 in Tokyo. "

        "Vida Dutton Scudder exemplifies the marriage of contemplation and action within an engaged Christian spirituality. As a contemplative laywoman, Scudder was a champion for peace, social action, and women throughout her life. ",
        "Scudder was born on December 15th, 1861, the child of Congregationalist missionaries in India. In the 1870s, Vida and her mother were prepared for confirmation in the Episcopal Church by Phillips Brooks, then Rector of Trinity Church, Copley Square, Boston, and later Bishop of Massachusetts. After studying English literatureat Smith College and Oxford University, Scudder began teaching at Wellesley College. Her love of scholarship was matched by her social conscience and deep spirituality. As a young woman, Scudder founded the College Settlements Association, joined the Society of Christian Socialists, and, in 1889, began a lifelong association with the Society of the Companions of the Holy Cross, a community living in the world and devoted to intercessory prayer. ",
        "In 1893, Scudder took a leave of absence from Wellesley to workwith Helena Stuart Dudley in founding Denison House in Boston, a “college settlement,” where wealthy college-educated women provided social services to poor immigrant neighbors, in conversation withthe local parish priest. Stresses from teaching and her activism ledto a breakdown in 1901. After two years’ recuperation in Italy, she returned renewed and became even more active in church and socialist groups; she started a group for Italian immigrants at Denison House and took an active part in organizing the Women’s Trade Union League. In 1911, Scudder founded The Episcopal Church Socialist League, and formally joined the Socialist party. Her support of the Lawrence, Massachusetts, textile workers’ strike in 1912 drew agreat deal of criticism and threatened her teaching position. Though she initially supported World War I, she joined the Fellowship of Reconciliation in 1923, and by the 1930s was a firm pacifist. ",
        "Throughout her life, Scudder’s primary relationships and support network were women. After retirement, she authored 16 books on religious and political subjects, combining her intense activism with an equally vibrant spirituality. “If prayer is the deep secret creative force that Jesus tells us it is, we should be very busy with it,” she wrote characteristically, adding that there was one sure way “of directly helping on the Kingdom of God. That way is prayer. Social intercession may be the mightiest force in the world.” Vida Scudder died on October 9th, 1954. "

        "Born into a family of peasant farmers in the village of Pouy in Gascony in 1581, Vincent de Paul showed an early aptitude for reading and writing. His father sold his oxen in order to send the boy to seminary, hoping that a clerical career would allow him to support the family. Later kidnapped by pirates and sold as a slave, he studied alchemy under his master. While traveling to Istanbul, the alchemist died; Vincent was sold again, this time to a former Franciscan who had likewise been enslaved, but became a Muslim in exchanged for his freedom. Vincent shared the Gospel with his new master’s wife; she was baptized and convinced her husband to return to the faith of Christ and escape to France. Later, while serving as a parish priest near Paris, Vincent began to devote his attention to serving the poor and destitute. With the support of the noble women of the parish, a ministry developed for visiting, feeding, and nursing the poor in and around Paris. As this ministry grew, he came to rely on a widow, Louise de Marillac, to oversee their efforts. ",
        "Louise de Marillac was born to a wealthy family near Le Jeux in Picardy; by the time she was fifteen years old both of her parents had died. She longed to become a nun, but was discouraged; instead, she wed Antonie Le Gras. Her husband died twelve years later; the union produced one child, a son with special needs. Francis de Sales, later Bishop of Geneva, who wrote the highly influential Introduction to the Devout Life became her spiritual director. At age thirty-two it was revealed to her in a vision that God would bring her a new spiritual director, whose face she was shown. When she met Vincent de Paul, she recognized his face from her vision. He invited Louise to assist in his expanding charitable ministry. She accepted his offer, poured herself into this ministry, and soon became the leader of the sisterhood. She led the order until her death in 1660. ",
        "In 1633, Vincent de Paul and Louise de Marillac formally founded The Sisters of Charity of Saint Joseph (later the Company of the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent De Paul), or more commonly, the “Grey Sisters,” the first non-cloistered religious order for women devoted to acts of charity. The ministry of the Grey Sisters grew to include founding hospitals, orphanages, and schools. The nineteenth century revival of religious orders within Anglicanism was greatly influenced by the spirituality and the work of the Daughters of Charity."

In the early years of the fourth century, the fervent Christian community in Spain fell victim to a persecution ordered by the Roman emperors Diocletian and Maximian. Dacian, governor of Spain, arrested both Valerius and his deacon Vincent, and had them imprisoned at Valencia. ",
        "According to one account, Valerius had a speech impediment, and so Vincent was often called upon to preach for him. When the two prisoners were challenged to renounce their faith, amid threats of torture and death, Vincent said to his bishop, “Father, if you order me, I will speak.” Valerius is said to have replied, “Son, as I committed you to dispense the word of God, so I now charge you to answer in vindication of the faith which we defend.” ",
        "The young deacon then told the governor that he and his bishop had no intention of betraying the one true God. The vehemence and enthusiasm of Vincent’s defense showed no caution in his defiance of the judges, and Dacian’s fury was increased by this exuberance in Christian witness. Valerius was exiled, but the angry Dacian ordered that Vincent be tortured. ",
        "Although the accounts of his martyrdom have been heavily embellished, Augustine of Hippo writes that Vincent’s unshakeable faith enabled him to endure grotesque punishments and, finally, death.  Vincent’s cult spread rapidly throughout the early church, and he was venerated as a bold and outspoken preacher and witness to the truth of the living Christ.  He remains an important model for the ministry of deacons not only in doing works of justice and mercy, but also in proclaiming and teaching the truths of the Christian faith to the church and to the world."

        "William Augustus Muhlenberg was born in Philadelphia in 1796, into a prominent German Lutheran family, and was drawn to the Episcopal Church by its use of English. He deliberately chose to remain unmarried in order to free himself for a variety of ministries. As a young priest, he was deeply involved in the Sunday School movement, and was concerned that the church should minister to all social groups. Aware of the limitations of the hymnody of his time, he wrote hymns and compiled hymnals, thus widening the range of music in Episcopal churches. ",
        "For twenty years he was head of a boys’ school in Flushing, New York. The use of music, flowers, and color, and the emphasis on the Church Year in the worship there became a potent influence. In 1846, he founded the Church of the Holy Communion in New York City. Again, he was bold and innovative, establishing free pews for everyone, a parish school, a parish unemployment fund, and trips to the country for poor city children. His conception of beauty in worship, vivid and symbolic, had at its heart the Holy Communion itself, celebrated every Sunday. It was there that Anne Ayres founded the Sisterhood of the Holy Communion. In 1857, the two of them founded St. Luke’s Hospital, where Muhlenberg was the pastor-superintendent and she the matron. ",
        "Muhlenberg’s concern for sacramental worship and evangelism led him and several associates to memorialize the General Convention of 1853, calling for flexibility in worship and polity to enable the church better to fulfill its mission. The insistence of the “Memorial” on traditional Catholic elements—the Creeds, the Eucharist, and Episcopal ordination—together with the Reformation doctrine of grace, appealed to people of varying views. Although the church was not ready to adopt the specific suggestions of the Memorial, its influence was great, notably in preparing the ground for liturgical reform and ecumenical action. ",
        "Muhlenberg’s last great project was an experiment in Christian social living, St. Johnland on Long Island. Although his dream of a Christian city was not realized, several of its philanthropic institutions survive. "

        "William Laud was born in 1573 and became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1633, having been Charles I’s principal ecclesiastical adviser for several years before. He was the most prominent of a new generation of church leaders who disliked many of the more Protestant ritual practices that had developed during the reign of Elizabeth I, and who were bitterly opposed by the Puritans. ",
        "Laud believed that the Church of England was in direct continuity with the medieval church, and he stressed the unity of church and state, exalting the role of the monarch as the supreme governor of the church. He emphasized the centrality of the priesthood and the sacraments, particularly the Eucharist, and he caused consternation by insisting on reverencing the altar, returning it to its pre-Reformation position against the eastern wall of the church and hedging it about with rails. ",
        "As head of the courts of High Commission and Star Chamber, Laud was abhorred for the harsh sentencing of prominent Puritans. His identification with the unpopular policies of King Charles, his support of the war against Scotland in 1640, and his efforts to make the church independent of Parliament all made him widely disliked. He was impeached for treason by the Long Parliament in 1640, and finally beheaded on January 10th, 1645. ",

Honored as a martyr and condemned as an intolerant bigot, he was compassionate in his defense of the rights of the common people against the landowners. He was honest, devout, and loyal to the king and to therights and privileges of the Church of England. He tried to reform and protect the church in accordance with his sincere convictions. But in many ways he was out of step with the views of the majority of people in his day, especially about the “Divine Right of Kings.” ",

        "“First presbyter of the Church,” was the well-deserved, if unofficial, title of the sixth rector of Grace Church, New York City. William Reed Huntington provided a leadership characterized by breadth, generosity, scholarship, and boldness. He was the acknowledged leader in the House of Deputies of the Episcopal Church’s General Convention during a period of intense stress and conflict within the Church. His reconciling spirit helped preserve the unity of the Episcopal Church in the painful days after the beginning of the schism that resulted in the formation of the Reformed Episcopal Church. ",
        "In the House of Deputies, of which he was a member from 1871 until 1907, Huntington showed active and pioneering vision in making daring proposals. As early as 1871, his motion to revive the primitive order of “deaconesses” began a long struggle, which culminated in 1889 in canonical authorization for that order. Huntington’s parish immediately provided facilities for this new ministry, and Huntington House became a training center for deaconesses and other women workers in the Church. ",
        "Christian unity was Huntington’s great passion throughout his ministry. In his book, The Church Idea (1870), he attempted to articulate the essentials of Christian unity. The grounds he proposedas a basis for unity were presented to, and accepted by, the House of Bishops in Chicago in 1886, and, with some slight modification, were adopted by the Lambeth Conference in 1888. The “Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral” has become a historic landmark for the Anglican Communion. It is included on pages 876–878 of the Book of Common Prayer, among the Historical Documents of the Church. ",
        "In addition to his roles as ecumenist and statesman, Huntington is significant as a liturgical scholar. It was his bold proposal to revise the Prayer Book that led to the revision of 1892, providing a hitherto unknown flexibility and significant enrichment. His Collect for Monday in Holy Week, now used also for Fridays at Morning Prayer, is itself an example of skillful revision. In it he takes two striking clauses from the exhortation to the sick in the 1662 Prayer Book, and uses them as part of a prayer for grace to follow the Lord in his sufferings. "

        "Temple was born on October 15th, 1881. His father, Dr. Frederick Temple, Bishop of Exeter and then of London, became Archbishop of Canterbury when William was fifteen. Growing up at the heart of the Church of England, William’s love for it was deep and lifelong. Endowed with a brilliant mind, Temple took a first-class honors degree in classics and philosophy at Oxford, where he was then elected Fellow of Queen’s College. At the age of twenty-nine he became headmaster of Repton School, and then, in quick succession, rector of St. James’s Church, Piccadilly, Bishop of Manchester, and Archbishop of York. ",
        "Although he was never subject to poverty himself, he developed a passion for social justice which shaped his words and his actions.  He owed this passion to a profound belief in the Incarnation.  He wrote that in Jesus Christ God took flesh and dwelt among us, and, as a consequence, “the personality of every man and woman is sacred.”  In 1917, Temple resigned from St. James’s, Piccadilly, to devote his energies to the “Life and Liberty” movement for reform within the Church of England.  Two years later, an Act of Parliament led to the setting up of the Church Assembly, which for the first time gave the laity a voice in church governance. ",
        "As bishop, and later as archbishop, Temple committed himself to seeking “the things which pertain to the Kingdom of God.” He understood the Incarnation as giving worth and meaning not only to individuals but to all of life. He therefore took the lead in establishing the Conference on Christian Politics, Economics, and Citizenship (COPEC), held 1924. In 1940, he convened the great Malvern Conference to reflect on the social reconstruction that would be needed in Britain once the Second World War was over. At the same time, he was a prolific writer on theological, ecumenical, and social topics, and his two-volume Readings in St. John’s Gospel, written in the early days of the war, rapidly became a spiritual classic. ",
        "In 1942, Temple was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury and reached an even wider audience through his wartime radio addresses and newspaper articles. However, the scope of his responsibilities and the pace he set himself took their toll. On October 26th, 1944, he died at Westgate-on-Sea, Kent, after only two and a half years at Canterbury. "

Before his betrayal and death, he had finished and revised his translation of the New Testament, and had completed a translation of the Pentateuch and of Jonah and, though he did not live to see them published, of the historical books from Joshua through 2 Chronicles.

        "In 698, he founded the monastery of Echternach, near Trier. Hiswork was frequently disturbed by the conflict of the pagan Frisians with the Franks, and for a time he left the area to work among the Danes. For three years, from 719–722, he was assisted by Boniface, who at a later time came back to Frisia to strengthen the mission. In a very real sense, Willibrord prepared the way for Boniface’s more successful achievements by his relations with the Frankish rulers and the papacy, who thus became joint sponsors of missionary work. He died at Echternach, November 7th, 739. "

        "Wulfstan was one of the few Anglo-Saxon bishops to retain his see after the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Beloved by all classes of society for his humility, charity, and courage, he was born in Warwickshire about 1008, and educated in the Benedictine abbeys of Evesham and Peterborough. He spent most of his life in the cathedral monastery of Worcester as monk, prior, and then as bishop of the see from 1062 until his death on January 18, 1095. He accepted the episcopate with extreme reluctance, but having resigned himself to it, he administered the diocese with great effectiveness. As bishop, he rapidly became famous for his continued monastic asceticism and personal sanctity.",
        "Even though Wulfstan had been sympathetic to King Harold of Wessex, he was among those who submitted to William the Conqueror at Berkhamstead in 1066. He therefore was allowed to retain his see. At first, the Normans tended to disparage him for his lack of learning and his inability to speak French, but he became one of William’s most trusted advisers and administrators, and remained loyal in support of William I and William II in their work of reform and orderly government. He assisted in the compilation of the Domesday Book and supported William I against the rebellious barons in 1075. William came to respect a loyalty based on principle and not on self-seeking. Archbishop Lanfranc also recognized the strength of Wulfstan’s character, and the two men worked together to end the practice at Bristol of kidnaping Englishmen and selling them as slaves in Ireland.",
        "Because he was the most respected prelate of the Anglo-Saxon Church, Wulfstan’s profession of canonical obedience to Lanfranc, William the Conqueror’s Archbishop of Canterbury, proved to be a key factor in the transition from Anglo-Saxon to Anglo-Norman Christianity. William’s policy, however, was to appoint his own fellow Normans to the English episcopate, and, by the time of William’s death in 1087, Wulfstan was the only English-born bishop still living."

        "Zenaida, Philonella, and Hermione were three early Christian women who are commemorated in the Orthodox Church as the first “unmercenary physicians”- Christian medical doctors who offered their skill to everyone and refused to accept payment.  ",
        "According to Orthodox tradition, Zenaida and Philonella were sisters, born into a well-educated and wealthy Jewish family in the city of Tarsus.  They were baptized by their brother Jason after his conversion and ordination as a priest.  ",
        "Both sisters were said to have been well-educated at home in both philosophy and medicine, but they were unable to find employment in either field in an era when both professions were controlled by men.  Therefore, they built a chapel, two cells, and a medical clinic on the outskirts of the city of Thessaly, where they devoted themselves to treating all who came to them regardless of their ability to pay, and refused to accept any money in exchange for their services.  ",
        "Philonella was said to be skilled in experimental treatments for diseases that were regarded as incurable, and Zenaida specialized in pediatric medicine and the treatment of psychological disorders, particularly depression.  Zenaida became particularly renowned as a spiritual director as well as a physician.  Three of her male disciples founded a monastery a short distance away from the sisters.  Varying accounts are given of their death, with one tradition relating that they were killed by robbers, and others relating that they continued in their ministry until dying peacefully of old age.",
        "Hermione is the third early Christian woman to be given the title of “unmercenary physician.”  She is reported to be one of the daughters of Philip the Deacon (Acts 6).  After studying medicine in Caesarea, she went to Ephesus in the hopes of meeting the Apostle John, but found that he had already died.  She therefore used her income to open up a medical clinic, with the help of her younger sister Eukhidia. Eventually, she expanded the clinic into a residential facility to allow for more extended treatment.  Orthodox Christians believe that this was the first example of a Christian hospital, and it became the inspiration for later developments in Christian medical care, particularly in the Christian East.

Zita was born into a poor family, but one in the which the Christian faith was emphasized.  One of her uncles was a hermit, a sister became a nun, and the entire family was faithful in worship together, both at church and in their home.",
        "At the age of 12 she entered the service of the Fatinelli family in Lucca.  Although little more than a child, she maintained the serious faith that she had been taught by her family.  Scrupulous in the exercise of her domestic duties, she embodied Paul’s advice in Colossians 3:23, “Whatever your task, put yourselves into it, as done for the Lord and not for your masters.” Her earnest diligence, however, was first met with scorn from both her employers and her fellow servants. Nevertheless, she continued faithfully in her work and exhibited a peace that surpassed comprehension. Through her perseverance in doing good, she eventually earned the respect and affection of the whole household. ",
        "In due course, the once despised servant became the housekeeper. As head of the household staff, Zita demonstrated such Christlike benevolence that she come to be venerated throughout Lucca even before her death.  Mindful of the poverty in which she had been raised, she gave away most of her income to those in need.  ",
        "After her death, the popularity of her cult spread as far as England, where she is called Sitha; images of her may be found in churches throughout southern England.  In popular piety, she is often entreated in order to find lost keys."
